      "content": "Soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces’ 810th “Mountain” Brigade recently conducted a drill for emergency situations in “extreme weather conditions,” the military announced on Monday evening.The brigade-level exercise, which was held under the command of the 210th “Bashan” Division in the Mount Hermon and Mount Dov sectors on the northern border, sought to maintain and strengthen readiness.“As part of the exercise, the brigade’s reserve and regular forces, together with medical units, practiced scenarios of transitioning from routine to emergency, rocket fire, terrorist infiltrations into outposts and the simultaneous evacuation of dozens of wounded,” the army said.“In addition, the Technology and Logistics Directorate personnel in the division completed a logistical operation during which they renovated outposts, established extensive infrastructure, and distributed winter gear to the troops serving in the sector,” the IDF statement added.A winter storm dubbed “Byron” is moving toward the Jewish state from Greece and is expected to bring unusually heavy precipitation and strong winds from Wednesday through Friday.Most of the rainfall—forecast to reach four to six inches in some areas—is expected to fall in the coastal plain and the Shephelah (the Judean Foothills), though rain is anticipated nationwide.The heaviest rainfall is expected on Thursday,Kan Newsreported, adding that there are “serious concerns” about possible flooding, including in the Judean Desert, the Dead Sea area and the Arava.The postIDF conducts emergency drill for extreme weather conditions in northappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "A newly discovered segment of a Hasmonean-period city wall inside theTower of David Jerusalem’s Kishle—the historic Ottoman and later British Mandate police station on the museum grounds—has provided archaeologists with rare physical evidence of Jerusalem’s fortifications during the Maccabean era.The discovery was made, coincidentally, ahead of the Chanukah festival during the current phase of the Tower of David Jerusalem Museum’s extensive renewal and conservation project in the Kishle, supported by the Schulich family of Canada.The excavation is led by Dr. Amit Re’em, the Jerusalem District Archaeologist for the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA), who began excavating the Kishle in 1999. Re’em said Hasmonean remains are scarce in this part of Jerusalem’s Old City, making the discovery particularly meaningful.“The Kishle contains many layers—Herodian, Roman, Crusader, Ottoman, and British—but Hasmonean architecture in this area has been limited and often debated,” said Re’em. “This new wall segment corresponds to the period we expect from the second century BCE and provides solid physical confirmation of the Hasmonean fortifications on Jerusalem’s western side.”How and why the wall was destroyed is still not clear, the museum said.Tower of David Jerusalem director Eilat Lieber stands in front of the Kishle site, where a Hasmoneon wall was discovered, Dec. 8, 2025. Photo by Sharon Altshul.New wingEilat Lieber, director and chief curator of the Tower of David Jerusalem Museum, told JNS that she was excited that the archaeologists exposed the beautiful wall from the Hasmonean period. Calling it “a dream come true,” she said that the Kishle building will become a new wing of the Tower of David named the Schulich Wing for Archaeology, Art and Innovation.Further, she said, “A week before Chanukah, it’s amazing to see. Here you can feel the history, and you can touch it in the Tower of David. Especially today, we want to engage young people. People can come and see how impressive the story is. How it happened here two thousand years ago.” The plan is for the new wing to continue telling stories of Jerusalem, where artists will make it relevant to our time. As Lieber envisions, “where visitors will learn from the past for the future.”The newly exposed section of the wall is currently undergoing conservation, stabilization, and full scientific documentation.Museum officials said the new wing will open to the public in approximately two years, when all preservation work is complete, and the Kishle’s interior pathways are rebuilt to safely accommodate visitors. The wall will eventually form a visible part of the Kishle’s archaeological route after careful long-term planning.Chanukah programming highlights the storyWhile the Kishle itself will remain closed until conservation is completed, the Tower of David is incorporating the discovery into its “Hanukkah of Heroes” programming throughout the holiday, including guided tours and educational activities focused on Jerusalem’s heroic figures and archaeological layers.Re’em said that the wall adds an important reference point for scholars reconstructing the story and defences of Jerusalem in the time of the Hasmoneans.“This helps us map the city’s western boundary during a crucial period in Jewish history,” he said. “In terms of understanding the Jerusalem of the Chanukah story, this is a major and clarifying discovery.”Full details and registration are available on the museum’swebsite.The postHasmonean wall uncovered in Tower of David sheds light on Maccabean periodappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "Rom Braslavski, accompanied by his father, took the stage on Sunday at a special event hosted by Italy’s ruling party, Fratelli d’Italia, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.“For two years I was held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Oct. 7 is a terrible trauma. I was kidnapped by the terrorists from Gaza. I saw the horrors with my own eyes,” said Braslavski.“I witnessed the massacre. I saw young, beautiful women thrown on the ground, riddled with bullets, their clothes torn, and rivers of blood were on the road while in the background the cries and screams of ‘Allahu Akbar’ were heard.“I saw inside a large yellow garbage can full of bodies,” he continued. “Women, adults, small children, all covered in blood, and they were murdered only because they are Jews and Israelis.”The 22-year-old from Jerusalem also met with Riccardo Pacifici, the former president of Rome’s Jewish community, as well as other prominent figures.Braslavskisaid that during his captivity, he was tortured daily, leaving him with lasting physical and mental scars. He described the experience as inhumane and unfit even for animals.“Until two months ago, I was inside Gaza, 131 feet (40 meters) underground. Torn clothes after I hadn’t showered for at least a month, I hadn’t eaten for entire days. And look how I am dressed today—the wheel has turned and it’s a divine miracle,” said Braslavski.In a separate interview, he noted having rejected Hamas’s demand to convert to Islam, adding, “I was born a Jew and will die a Jew.”Originally published byIsrael Hayom.The post‘Garbage can full of bodies’: Freed hostage recounts horrors to Italian leadersappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar and his Bolivian counterpart Fernando Aramayo were scheduled to meet in Washington on Tuesday to sign an agreement restoring diplomatic relations between the two nations, Israel’s Foreign Ministry announced Monday.Bolivia’s Finance Minister José Gabriel Espinoza will also participate in the event, the ministry said.The agreement ends a two-year diplomatic freeze that began when the previous government, led by the Socialist Mas Party, severed ties with Israel in the wake of Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, announcing the move on Nov. 1 of that year. Chile, Colombia and Honduras soon all followed suit, recalling their ambassadors from Israel and downgrading official representation.Sa’ar spoke with Bolivia’s center-right President Rodrigo Paz the day after his election in October, marking one of the new leader’s first diplomatic calls. During that conversation, Sa’ar conveyed Israel’s desire to open a new chapter in relations, while Paz expressed his intention to lead Bolivia toward greater international engagement and reestablish ties with Israel, according to the ministry statement.In November, Eden Bar-Tal, director-general of Israel’s Foreign Ministry,representedthe country at Paz’s inauguration in Bolivia.Earlier this month, Bolivialiftedvisa requirements for Israeli travelers, following weeks of negotiations between the two foreign ministries to finalize the agreement text and joint statement.The postBolivia, Israel to renew diplomatic tiesappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "If Israel had surrendered to U.S. demands in the 1990s to give up the Golan Heights, how many Israeli lives would have been lost in the ensuing 25 years?By Moshe Phillips, JNSThe bureaucratic diplomats at the United Nations again demonstrated their addiction to attacking Israel’s best interests with a vote on Dec. 2 about the Golan.In a resolution sponsored by Egypt, 123 nations voted for Syrian control over the Golan Heights and for Israel to return to the June 4, 1967 lines.The resolution received much more support than in 2024, when 97 nations voted against multiple generations of Israeli families remaining in their homes on the Golan.The resolution states that Israel’s decision in December 1981 to expand sovereignty must be rescinded.What’s more, the U.N. General Assembly had a second vote on Dec. 5 that labeled Israeli communities on the Golan as “illegal.” A total of 146 nations voted in favor of this resolution.Can you imagine the danger Israel would have faced last December when chaos enveloped Syria? Or if, on Oct. 7, 2023, Iranian proxy terrorists on a Syrian-controlled Golan had joined Hamas and Hezbollah, and opened up a third front against the Jewish state?If Israel had surrendered to U.S. demands in the 1990s to give up the Golan Heights, how many Israeli lives would have been lost in the ensuing 25 years?On March 25, 2019, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the following to U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House: “Mr. President, just as Israel stood tall in 1967, just as it stood tall in 1973, Israel stands tall today. We hold the high ground, and we shall never give it up. Mr. President, we have a saying in Israel. I’ll say it in Hebrew. It says, Ha’am im Hagolan. That means, ‘The people are with the Golan.’ But thanks to you, we now know that there are two peoples who stand with the Golan: the people of Israel and the people of America. So, on behalf of all the people of Israel: Thank you, President Trump.”On the same day as the first U.N. vote about the Golan, Ronald S. Lauder, president of the World Jewish Congress, was speaking across town at theIsrael Hayomsummit in Manhattan.He stated that there is “a full-scale assault on truth, on democracy and on the safety of Jewish people everywhere.”He could have said “everywhere at the United Nations” and been correct.Additionally, Lauder declared that “there are Muslims and Arabs who reject terrorism, who reject extremism, who reject using Israel as an excuse for hatred. Let us build a coalition so strong, so united, so determined, that no extremist movement can fracture it.”Lauder, who has served as president of the WJC since 2007, is demanding far too much from Israel. Israel cannot be expected to build this fantasy “coalition” while Hamas is still armed and in power in Gaza. In fact, it shouldn’t even be discussed now.Truthfully, such ideas as this “coalition” have no place in the current Middle East era of autocracies, when there are no true democracies in the region besides Israel.The Arab world is legendary for revolutions and violent coups; it is beyond naive to suggest that Israel can risk a Palestinian state of any size just to be part of some anti-extremist “coalition” that could prove to be short-lived and extremely ineffective.And make no mistake: A Palestinian state is the price that the Gulf sheikdoms and other authoritarian, repressive regimes that comprise the region would exact from Israel to launch this “coalition.”In August 2025, Lauder said “the inciteful calls” from Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich to “ ‘bury the idea of a Palestinian state’ are wholly unbecoming of a representative of the state of Israel.”American Jewish leaders must come to understand that, to critics of Israel, there is no difference between “settlements” in Judea and Samaria and “settlements” on the Golan.When American Jews attack the rights of Jewish families to live in Judea and Samaria, the Israelis in the Golan are put even more at risk.Just weeks after Lauder’s broadside against Smotrich, the Hamas-led terrorist invasion of communities in southern Israel caused Israelis who were previously open to it to rethink a Palestinian state.Perhaps the best example of this is Israeli President Isaac Herzog, who in January said toCNN’sFareed Zakaria, that “the idea of the two-state solution is something which, on record, I supported in the past, many times. But I would say that I had a wake-up call following Oct. 7, in the sense that I want to hear my neighbors say how much they object, regret, condemn and do not accept in any way the terrible tragedy of the terror attack of Oct. 7 and the fact that terror cannot be the tool to get there.”It is long past time for American Jewish leaders to “wake up” and realize that, just as Israel’s leaders in the 1990s were right to stand with the Israeli communities in the Golan Heights, they are right today to support Israelis who wish to remain in Judea and Samaria, despite that critics such as U.N. diplomats, Zakaria and even Lauder dismiss these communities as “settlements.”Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "Hamas will be disarmed “either the easy way or the hard way,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Knesset lawmakers on Monday, responding to terror chief Khaled Mashaal’s rejection of President Donald Trump’s demands for the Gaza Strip to be fully demilitarized.“How did Khaled Mashaal put it yesterday? ‘We will continue on our path and we will not disarm.’ But we—and I commit to you—will not allow Hamas murderers to rearm and threaten us again,” he declared during a 40-signature debate in the Knesset, which the opposition can call once a month and which the prime minister is required to attend.“We are acting every day to prevent this, and this mission will be completed either the easy way or the hard way,” he continued.צפו בדברים שאמרתי היום במליאת הכנסת >>pic.twitter.com/m9kXKyhxIC— Benjamin Netanyahu – בנימין נתניהו (@netanyahu)December 8, 2025Mashaal, in a pre-recorded speech broadcast at an anti-Israel summit held in Istanbul over the weekend, rejected the U.S.- and U.N.-backed demands for Hamas to disarm and for the Strip to be demilitarized.“Protecting the resistance project and its weapons is the right of our people to defend themselves,” stated Mashaal.“The resistance and its weapons are the honor and pride of theummah[the Islamic nation],” Mashaal continued. “A thousand statements are not worth a single projectile of iron.”Mashaal in his taped speech also dismissed “all forms of guardianship, mandate and re-occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and all of Palestine,” rejecting another key part of Trump’s plan for Gaza, which calls for a transitional governing body supervised by a Board of Peace.A U.S. State Department spokespersontold JNSon Sunday that Washington expects Hamas “to abide by the deal they signed.”“Hamas has agreed to all 20 points of President Trump’s 20 Point Plan. That means Gaza will be fully demilitarized for the sake of Gazans,” the spokesperson said in a statement emailed to JNS on Sunday afternoon.Netanyahu reiterated on Monday that the terror group is in “constant violation” of the U.S.-brokered truce deal that went into effect Oct. 10.However, Netanyahu said, “We are on the verge of completing the first stage of President Trump’s 20-point plan, and now we are focusing on the next mission: disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip.”He stressed that the Jewish state would not waver in its “sacred mission” of returning for burial the remains of Master Sgt.Ran Gvili, an officer in the Israel Police’s elite Special Patrol Unit (Yasam) who was murdered by Palestinian terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose body was taken to Gaza.Gvili, who battled terrorists during the attack, is the final remaining captive in the Strip; his remains have been held in the enclave for 794 days.Under the U.S.-brokered ceasefire and hostage-release agreement that went into effect last month, Hamas committed to returning to Israel all 28 bodies the terrorist group was holding captive on Oct. 13.However, the terrorist organization slow-walked their return, delaying its disarmament, which is set to take place in the second phase with a deployment of Trump’s proposed International Stabilization Force.The postNetanyahu again vows to disarm Hamas as Mashaal backtracks on US planappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "From desalination plants on the Mediterranean coast to underground reservoirs and pipelines stretching across the country, Israel’s water system has become one of the most heavily protected civilian infrastructures in the world.At the center of that formidable task is Col. (res.) Danny Lacker, head of the water security, emergency and cyber division at the Israel Water Authority. Lacker oversees national planning to protect Israel’s water from terrorism, cyber sabotage, energy collapse and natural disasters—threats that have only intensified since Oct. 7, 2023.Col. (res.) Danny Lacker, head of the water security, emergency and cyber division at the Israel Water Authority. Credit: Courtesy.“Every water facility in Israel depends on electricity,” Lacker told JNS in an exclusive interview in his office at the end of November. “Desalination alone uses about half a percent of the country’s total power supply. If the power goes down, everything is at risk. That’s why emergency generators across the system are absolutely critical.”Israel operates desalination plants across the country, with major new facilities under construction, each costing hundreds of millions of dollars and contracted under long-term build-operate-transfer agreements. Though privately built, Israel’s water infrastructure is regulated by the state, with all funding ultimately coming from water tariffs paid by consumers.“All of Israel’s water security is paid for by the public,” Lacker said. “The government doesn’t directly fund it. That’s why efficiency, reliability and resilience are not luxuries—they are necessities.”Preparing for the worstAmong the most dangerous scenarios Israel plans for is a major earthquake.“In one second, half a million people could find themselves disconnected from water,” Lacker said. “Pipes could crack, reservoirs could collapse, sewage could mix with drinking water. That is our worst-case civilian disaster scenario.”The second major danger is terror-driven contamination. “Even a small contamination attempt has an enormous psychological impact,” Lacker said. “If people think their water is unsafe, panic spreads instantly.”Israel’s protective systems include layered physical security, advanced chemical detection, real-time water quality monitoring and automated shutdown capabilities. Some sites even use bio-detection through fish behavior analysis to identify sudden changes in water composition.In parallel, Israel has built a nationwide emergency water reserve capable of supplying hundreds of thousands of civilians with alternative water and temporary sewage systems if core infrastructure fails.Cyber war over waterThe cyber battlefield may now pose the most constant threat.“We are under daily cyberattack,” Lacker said. “Sometimes it’s criminals looking for ransom. Sometimes it’s state-backed actors. Sometimes it’s just a teenager trying to prove he can hack Jerusalem’s water systems.”During the recent war, hostile cyber forces attempted repeatedly to manipulate chlorine levels, disrupt water flow and create panic through false online videos claiming successful contamination.“They wanted to create fear more than damage,” he said. “And sometimes they succeeded in frightening people—even when no physical damage occurred.”To counter this, Israel operates a centralized Water Security Operations Center that monitors desalination plants, purification systems and recycling facilities nationwide in real time. The center integrates cyber experts with physical security, emergency teams and engineers.“We don’t just regulate from afar,” Lacker said. “We sit with the operators in real time. If one facility is attacked, the entire country responds within seconds.”Judea and Samaria: A complex water battlefieldWater security challenges grow even more complicated in Judea and Samaria, where infrastructure often crosses political and security boundaries.“Jewish communities and Arab villages frequently share the same pipelines,” Lacker said. “It’s not a matter of politics—it’s a single system.”Illegal water siphoning remains a constant problem, particularly during summer peaks, when agricultural theft drains supply from civilian networks. Military and water authority teams engage in continuous detection efforts, but unauthorized hookups often reappear within days.Meanwhile, contaminated sewage and neglected infrastructure create chronic health risks that spill across borders.“Water doesn’t respect political lines,” Lacker said. “That’s why engineering reality often collides with political constraints.”Global leadership through crisisIsrael’s water security expertise is now in demand worldwide. In recent years, Israel has dispatched emergency water teams to disaster zones in the United States, the Bahamas and elsewhere to restore contaminated systems and establish emergency supply networks.“After Hurricane Sandy, after floods in the Caribbean, after contamination events—Israel was there,” Lacker said. “We don’t just bring equipment. We bring experience.”Israel also supplies Jordan with some 60 million cubic meters of water annually as part of peace agreements.“In water, cooperation saves lives,” he said. “Even in a region of war, water creates quiet stability.”Looking ahead, Lacker believes Israel’s greatest advantage remains its ability to improvise under pressure.“We don’t think in rigid procedures,” he said. “We think in solutions. That’s why Israel leads in water technology, security and emergency response.”As the region remains on edge, Israel’s water defenders continue working far from public view, guarding the most basic necessity of life.“When missiles fly, water still must flow,” Lacker said. “That’s our mission.The postInside the battle to protect Israel’s water supplyappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "The Israel Defense Forces will “likely” need to intensify military operations in Southern Lebanon, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told JNS on Monday.“We are enforcing in Lebanon, without compromise, against any Hezbollah armament and any violation of the ceasefire,” Smotrich stated, speaking at a Knesset meeting of his Religious Zionism Party.“It is likely that we will soon need to return and operate there to preserve the gains achieved against Hezbollah,” he continued.“We will not allow Hezbollah to remain,” the minister vowed. “Residents of the north deserve to live in complete security in their communities,” with the Israel Defense Forces holding strategic positions beyond the border, he added.“There will no longer be a situation in which towns are the front line and the IDF is behind them. The IDF will be the front protecting the communities, and the communities will be behind it.“We will continue to strike Hezbollah and defeat it,” continued Smotrich, adding, “We will not repeat the mistakes of the past 20 years.”The IDF overnight Monday carried out strikes against Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure across Southern Lebanon, the military said.The targets included a compound used by Hezbollah’s Radwan Force to train operatives for attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers. Trainees there conducted shooting drills and received instruction in the use of various weapons, according to the IDF.Military structures and a launch site used by the Iranian-backed terror group to facilitate attacks on Israeli forces and the state were also hit, the  army said.The targets “constitute a violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and a threat to the State of Israel,” the IDF said, adding that it “will continue to operate to remove any threat.”Israeli forces recentlydismantleda Hezbollah tunnel in the Houla area of Southern Lebanon, the military said on Sunday. IDF troops had located and neutralized the tunnel during the war, but had now fully dismantled it to prevent any future exploitation.IDF soldiers also recently dismantled a Hezbollah weapons storage facility in Ayta ash-Shab.Lebanese Prime MinisterNawaf Salamtold Qatar’sAl Araby Television Networkon Saturday that Beirut is seeking to disarm all groups in the country’s south, including Hezbollah, by the end of the year.The terror group had “accepted the ceasefire agreement, which restricts weapons to the hands of state forces,” Salam told the channel. “We are committed to restricting weapons south of the Litani [River] by the end of the year, and in the remaining areas during the next year.”Days earlier, Jerusalem and Beirut dispatched officials totalksin Lebanon as “a first attempt to create a basis for economic relations and cooperation,” the Israeli Prime Minister’s Office announced.The Israeli representative, Uri Resnick, senior director for foreign policy at Jerusalem’s National Security Council, met in Naqoura with “relevant Lebanese civilian representatives” as well as Morgan Ortagus, the deputy U.S. special envoy to the Middle East.The meeting came after theIsrael Defense Forceswarned on Dec. 2 that Hezbollah was rapidly rebuilding its capabilities despite ongoing airstrikes since a truce deal last year.The ceasefire went into effect on Nov. 27, 2024, after more than a year of war that culminated in an intense two-month IDF campaign that decimated the Iranian proxy’s leadership. The agreement was finalized by the Israeli and Lebanese governments with the involvement of five mediating countries, including the United States.The postSmotrich: IDF ‘likely’ to step up enforcement in Lebanonappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "A Palestinian artist who’s helping to decorate Norway’s government building had previously expressed support for Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel, according to a document submitted to the prime minister in Oslo on Friday.Joel Ystebø, a lawmaker for the Christian Democratic Party, submitted the information to Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre in a query he filed about Jumana Manna, an artist who self-identifies as a Palestinian living in Berlin.“On October 7, 2023, the same day as Hamas’ terror against Israel, Manna went on Facebook and praised Hamas as creative, writing: ‘Long live the creativity of resistance’,” Ystebø wrote in the query. He sought Støre’s reaction to criticism that Manna was not an appropriate choice for curating art at a building damaged in a 2011 bombing by terrorist Anders Behring Breivik.The post in which Manna praised “resistance,” a common code word in anti-Israel circles for terrorism against Israelis or Jews, featured her posing next to a photo of gliders—such as Hamas terrorists used to raid border-adjacent towns, where they killed some 1,200 and abducted another 251 on Oct. 7.Støre has not replied to Ystebø’s query and his office has not answered a request for comment on the matter from JNS. Manna, too, did not reply to a request for comment.In 2023, she wrote on the website Hyperallergic that she regretted sharing the images online.“At the time I shared my stories on Instagram, it had not become apparent that hundreds had been deliberately shot and kidnapped. I regretted my own comments after the news revealed the extent of the violence,” Manna wrote.The story was exposed by Henrik Beckheim, a Norwegian-Jewish author and podcaster who was recently tipped off to it by an anonymous source who’s part of the Norwegian art scene, Beckheim told JNS.“What’s particularly disturbing here is that this person was made in charge of curating art at a building that was severely damaged in a terrorist attack,” said Beckheim. “Beyond symbolism, this seems like a security oversight. People working in government buildings need to undergo strict security clearance. So this raised the question: How was this not flagged?” he added.Støre was aware of Manna’s background, praising her in a Nov. 29 speech as the provider of a “solid Palestinian signature” to Oslo with her work on the renovated government building.“The Palestinian artist creates an 800 square-meter stone floor, a patchwork of different stones, donated by municipalities from all over our country,” he said of Manna. “There is something very symbolic about this, in front of what was a bombed-out office building. A solid Palestinian signature, in the middle of Oslo. From the destruction, Jumana Manna is building a beautiful, new foundation,” Støre said during a speech his office said was the “Prime Minister’s speech on the U.N. International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People.”Manna has titled her work at the new government building “Sebastia,” the name of a Palestinian village today, and also the name of a Jewish village established in 1974, the first in Judea and Samaria after it came under Israel’s control seven years earlier. It was later abandoned and reconstituted elsewhere, but Sebastia remains a symbol of the movement to reestablish a Jewish population in Judea and Samaria.The pro-Israel group With Israel for Peace (Med Israel for Fred—MIFF) said the scandal was part of a broader issue in Norway.“The most pressing issue in Norway is not individual Palestinian artists who cheer on military attacks on Israel, but strong political forces that support BDS and state-funded media that demonize and delegitimize the Jewish state,” Conrad Myrland, the CEO of MIFF, told JNS.Beckheim, the author, said the revelation about Manna coincides with disappointment in Støre among some Norwegian Jews over what they perceive as his pro-Palestinian bias.“It’s horrible what is going on with the prime minister and the foreign minister, and we saw this at this Kristallnacht event,” said Beckheim. He referred to Støre’s decision to attend an event organized by anti-Israel activists, which they said was a Holocaust commemoration. Jewish community representatives asked Støre to skip the event, arguing his attendance would lend legitimacy to an attempt to hijack the Holocaust to isolate Israel.“He ended up going there anyway, knowing full well knowing what we told him,” said Beckheim. The controversy around Manna “is not an isolated incident, it reflects a very worrisome situation that’s much broader than this one case.”The Jewish Community in Oslo had not replied to a request for comment at time of publication.The postNorway PM grilled on state-employed artist’s Oct. 7 praiseappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "French prosecutors have indicted a 42-year-old Algerian woman for allegedly trying to poison the Jewish family that had employed her, theLe Parisiennewspaperreportedon Monday.The defendant is scheduled to appear before a judge in Nanterre near Paris on Tuesday for actions attributed to her in January 2024, and which were allegedly motivated by Jew-hatred, according to the report.The defendant, identified only as “Leila Y.” in the French media, had worked for the family in Paris for two months under a false Belgian identity. In fact, she was under orders to leave France, a measure often employed against those found to have overstayed their visa permit. The family had three children, then aged 2, 5 and 7.The defendant has been charged with “administering a harmful substance resulting in incapacity exceeding eight days, committed on the grounds of race, ethnicity, nationality or religion,”Le Parisienreported.The woman who employed her had sensed abnormalities in various products, including wine, juice, bread and even a makeup kit that caused her skin irritations, the report said.The woman’s 5-year-old daughter told her that she’d seen the nanny deposit a soap-like liquid into a wine bottle, prompting the mother to confront Leila Y., the newspaper reported, based on court papers. The nanny allegedly responded by saying, “I knew I never should have been working for a Jew,” and brought up financial grievances.Police analyzed the products that the nanny had allegedly tampered with and found that they had indeed been poisoned, although the foreign agents introduced to the products were not lethal, the analysis showed.The nanny was placed under arrest in February 2024.Gilles-William Goldnadel, a former member of the CRIF executive board of French Jewry and a prominent lawyer who’s represented many victims of antisemitic hate crimes,toldtheRadio Jstation on Monday: “Unfortunately, I can’t say I’m astonished. Hate had been worked up to a fever pitch, notably by the France Unbowed [far-left] party, tied to the Islamist movement, until it has been infused, and this is the infusion.”Goldnadel recalled the murder of four Jews in 2012 in Toulouse and the murder of four hostages in a kosher market in Paris in 2015 by Islamists. “We live in a country where Jews, Jewish children, have been murdered, butchered. And this is a reminder of this reality, perpetrated by foreigners or Islamists,” he said.The postNanny charged with trying to poison French Jewish familyappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "An Israeli volunteer medic who treated people wounded in the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, said on Monday that he was “stunned” to discover that one of them had been appointed director of the Mossad, Israel’s famous intelligence agency.Moshe Weizman, 35, a volunteer medic with the United Hatzalah rescue service for the past 17 years, helped evacuate IDFMaj. Gen. Roman Gofman, who had been shot by Hamas terrorists and wounded in his leg during a firefight that raged near the Israeli border town of Sderot.Weizman said he applied a tourniquet to stop the bleeding and helped evacuate the injured commander to a local hospital without knowing who he was, other than a wounded officer.Only after the rescue did responders learn the identity of the wounded officer, the highest-ranking IDF officer wounded that day.Gofman, who had driven down to the south that fateful morning from central Israel, went on to treat dozens of others wounded over the next several days until he himself was injured in a rocket attack and hospitalized and underwent a year-long recovery, including four operations.A year after the incident, Weizman learned that Gofman had been appointed military secretary to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Last week, he learned that he had been chosen to be the new director of the Mossad.“I’m really stunned,” he told JNS.  “I have an enormous sense of satisfaction that I helped such a man.”“Our volunteers did what they always do,” said United Hatzalah’s president and founder Eli Beer. “They ran toward those in need and acted with professionalism and courage in the most dangerous conditions. Their lifesaving work under fire ensured that a severely wounded soldier survived and was later reunited with his family and a grateful country.”The postIsraeli medic who treated incoming Mossad director on Oct. 7 speaks outappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "An annual United Nations media seminar held purportedly to “enhance dialogue and understanding between media practitioners” and “support of a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict” largely turned into an Israel-bashing exercise last week.The International Media Seminar on Peace in the Middle East, which is several decades old, has beenmandatedby the U.N. General Assembly since 2022 as part of the “Special Information Programme on the Question of Palestine.”The mandate directs the U.N. Department of Global Communications to organize a seminar “to sensitize public opinion to the question of Palestine, support peace efforts, and promote Israeli-Palestinian dialogue—particularly by encouraging media contributions to peace.”The theme of this year’s seminar, held on Dec. 8 in New York, was “Breaking Barriers: Navigating the Dangers and Complexities of Reporting from Gaza and the West Bank” (Judea and Samaria).As with past seminars, the only Israeli media outlet placed on the program was one widely viewed as part of the hard left, with Haggai Mattar, executive director of+972 Magazine, taking part with a pre-recorded message.+972 Magazine, an English-language publication which is reportedly read mainly by an international audience, has called for boycotts of Israel and has reported that Israel is an apartheid state.Melissa Fleming, U.N. under-secretary-general for global communications and the seminar’s moderator, described+972 Magazineas “a groundbreaking media outlet” that “plays a crucial role in bridging divides through journalism,” praising Mattar’s work for bringing “nuanced perspectives to global audiences” and “challenges prevailing narratives.”Mattar’s message described an “Israeli genocide,” while claiming that “the Israeli media has by and large ignored what Israel has done to Palestinians. Genocide, the devastation, the destruction, the starvation of Gaza, has been just ignored by almost all of Israeli media.”Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Authority’s U.N. envoy, noted that the panel has previously invited Gideon Levy ofHaartez, who has also long called for boycotts of Israel in harshly critical reporting of the Jewish state.A JNS search of seminar guest lists dating back to 2020 revealed no Israeli journalists without ties to left-wing publications.Asked how the echo chamber created by inviting guests with a lack of ideological diversity creates a platform that helps to encourage media support of a peaceful settlement to the conflict, Fleming told JNS, “We remain open to all media organizations that support peace. Additional factors that influence the lineup are speaker availability, space and budget.”Jodie Ginsberg, CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, told seminar attendees that her organization “has been pushing for the suspension” of the European Union-Israel Association Agreement, which governs political dialogue and economic cooperation between the EU and Israel.Nasser Abu Bakr, chair of the Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate, delivered a pre-recorded message, stating that Palestinian journalists have been “subjected to the ugliest massacre in human history,” decrying what he says is “the first media genocide.”Pressed for suggestions or ideas as to how to advance the protection of journalists, Mansour suggested that the United Nations host a “huge international conference” of global journalists “to say something about what is really happening, particularly in the Gaza Strip,” while criticizing “globally known figures such as [CNNanchor and Israel critic Christiane] Amanpour and others, who should have the responsibility to come and to defend their colleagues in a global forum.”Ginsberg countered that such a conference is better suited to be held in Israel, “because the people that we really need to convince is Israel and the Israeli people,” adding that “We’ve had high-profile figures speak out publicly. Much of that gets neutered once it gets into Israel.”While multiple panelists criticized Israel for instituting a near-blanket restriction on international journalists from entering Gaza during the war, none of the three Palestinian journalists invited to speak mentioned any of the onerous restrictions placed on journalists by Hamas or the Palestinian Authority.Many news organizations have previously reported acts and threats of violence from Hamas for critical reporting, and a pattern of self-censorship by international journalists in Gaza as a result. The Palestinian Authority has also previously been chided for government control of media in Judea and Samaria.Tania Kraemer, chair of the Foreign Press Association, said during the panel discussion that a reopening of Gaza to international journalists “will bring greater awareness and greater scrutiny of Israel’s, and also Hamas’, actions.”Asked about the lack of acknowledgement of Palestinian governance crackdowns on free media during the seminar, Fleming said, “The United Nations consistently condemns all restrictions on press freedom, underscoring that such measures violate international human rights law.It advocates for strong protections for journalists and insists that all parties in armed conflicts ensure the free flow of information, as affirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and U.N. resolutions.”The postInstead of focusing on Middle East peace, UN media seminar targets Israelappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "Considerable tension has seized Israel's diplomatic apparatus as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepares for his sixth meeting with US President Donald Trump. The December 29 meeting will unfold at Trump's Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, necessitated by America's year-end holiday season.Trump intends to declare Phase 2 of the20-point frameworkwithin days, despite Hamas withholding deceased hostage, Israeli hero Sgt. 1st ClassRan Gvili, who perished defending Kibbutz Alumim during the October 7 massacre. The original framework required the terrorist organization to repatriate all captives within 72 hours before advancing to Phase 2.Israeli officials harbor hopes Trump will postpone the declaration until Gvili's recovery, yet even a formal Phase 2 announcement remains operationally ambiguous. The crux: Not a single nation hasvolunteered troops to combat Hamas. Azerbaijan Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov stated Monday that his government lacks answers to fundamental questions about the prospective force's mandate, \"rendering any decision on Azerbaijani military participation premature.\"Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu against the background of the Gaza Strip (Reuters / AP)A day earlier, Netanyahu assessed the nascent international force likely cannot execute its primary objective: stripping Hamas of weaponry. Given this reality, diplomatic officials anticipate Hamas disarmament will dominate the Trump-Netanyahu dialogue.Trump and his inner circle have repeatedly pledged to prevent Hamas governance in Gaza and ensure the Strip's demilitarization. The international coordination hub in Gaza (the Kiryat Gat Civil-Military Coordination Center) has already partitioned the territory into numerous compact sectors for sequential neutralization. Implementation methodology remains nebulous, with expectations Netanyahu will advocate for IDF authorization should alternative actors fail to materialize.Beyond Gaza, Trump and Netanyahu will architect responses to additional diplomatic and security imperatives. Paramount among these: Iran's weapons program resurgence, Hezbollah's persistent armament, and potential Syrian security arrangements.Next phase uncertaintyRegarding the final captive soldier's repatriation, Gvili, developments remain static. A Zeitoun neighborhood sweep yielded nothing.Israel Hayomconfirmed the Gvili family confronted US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz Monday, insisting Washington forestall Phase 2 advancement pending their son's recovery.Coordinator of Hostages and Missing Persons Brig. Gen. (Res.) Gal Hirsch briefed Waltz on operational status and retrieval initiatives. The ambassador articulated American resolve and personal dedication to mission completion and the soldier's dignified burial in Israel, yet declined to guarantee Phase 2 postponement.American officials advocate Phase 2 commencement regardless of Gvili's discovery and return, proposing announcement once Hamas demonstrably lacks precise location intelligence and exhausts search capabilities.Waltz earlier conferred with Netanyahu, continuing his Israel itinerary today with stops including the Kiryat Gat international headquarters.Danny Zaken contributed to this report.The postNetanyahu's Gaza dilemma heads to Mar-a-Lagoappeared first onwww.israelhayom.com.",

      "content": "We have spent years documenting the systematic infiltration of anti-Israel activists into state and local government. We’ve published ananalysisof the pipeline that moves candidates from campus chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine to city councils and state legislatures. We’ve built theMamdani Indexto track and score officials nationwide. We have warned that while traditional pro-Israel organizations focus on Congress, a parallel political infrastructure is being constructed beneath them—one school board, one city council, one state legislature seat at a time.This article is the field guide. Whether you’ve noticed something concerning about a candidate in your community, identified a troubling score on the Mamdani Index or simply want to understand what warning signs to watch for, this guide explains how to recognize these candidates, what tactics they use, and, most importantly, what you can do to stop them before Election Day.Perhaps you’ve already raised concerns with local Jewish organizations, and they’ve told you not to worry, that you’re overreacting, that the candidate has moderated, that engaging would be divisive.Do not listen to them. These organizations do not have the experience or expertise to operate in advocacy, plus they are organized as 501(c)(3) organizations that are prohibited from engaging in electioneering.That exact pattern, concerned community members raising alarms, establishment organizations dismissing them and problematic candidates winning as a result, has repeated across the country. In 2022, it happened in West Hollywood, Calif., with Chelsea Byers. In 2025, it happened in New York City with Zohran Mamdani. In both cases, the warning signs were visible. In both cases, the candidates won.If you’re reading this because you suspect a Mamdani-type candidate is emerging in your community, trust your instincts. These candidates deny, minimize and reframe. Organizing boycott, divestment and sanctions campaigns becomes “advocating for human rights.” Leading anti-Israel protests become “standing up for free speech.” The language shifts; the record remains.Do not accept reframing at face value. If a candidate claims they were merely supporting “free speech” or “human rights,” ask them directly: Do you support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state? Have you ever participated in chants calling for Israel’s elimination? What is your position on BDS? Document their answers.Many of these candidates are genuinely likable. They present extreme positions calmly and reasonably. They use humor to deflect criticism. They emphasize identity markers like LGBTQ+ status, immigrant background and youth that make attacks feel uncomfortable.Mamdani’s campaign included a rap video and regular displays of wit. When confronted about “Globalize the intifada,” he didn’t become defensive; he softly reframed it while appearing reasonable, making his critics seem shrill by comparison.Do not let personal charm distract from documented positions. Evaluate candidates on their organizational affiliations and public statements, not their campaign persona.These candidates build broad progressive coalitions that lend legitimacy without scrutinizing their Israel-related positions since those positions are most often unrelated. Union endorsements, environmental groups, LGBTQ+ organizations and housing advocates lend credibility while steering attention toward domestic issues.Mamdani’s mayoral campaign benefited from DSA infrastructure, Palestinian American activist Linda Sarsour’s fundraising and even international support from Jeremy Corbyn, former leader of the British Labour Party, despite his documented antisemitism controversies. The coalition provides cover, but the toxic ideology remains.‘This is a losing trade’Perhaps the most effective shield is endorsement or defense from Jewish organizations themselves. Mamdani-type candidates actively cultivate relationships with progressive Jewish groups and individual Jewish leaders who can vouch for them when concerns arise.WhenChelsea Byersfaced scrutiny during her 2022 West Hollywood campaign, a letter signed by leaders from Democrats for Israel chapters, Progressive Zionists of California, the California Young Democrats Jewish Caucus and other Jewish organizations declared that she “is not antisemitic” and that “her views have evolved.” The letter urged voters to focus on local issues, arguing that “this race should be about West Hollywood, not the West Bank.”This is the playbook. Jewish organizational cover allows candidates to dismiss criticism as bad-faith attacks while pointing to Jewish endorsers as evidence of their moderation. The signatories may be well-meaning, but their intervention provides exactly the legitimacy these candidates need to neutralize opposition.When evaluating such endorsements, consider whether the endorsers actually reviewed the candidate’s full record or simply accepted their current self-presentation. Ask whether they have the political experience and ongoing leverage to hold the candidate accountable after the election, or whether they are primarily focused on social services, interfaith work or other communal priorities that leave them poorly equipped to vet political candidates.Jewish cover is the most valuable currency a Mamdani-type candidate can acquire. Once obtained, it becomes extremely difficult to raise concerns without appearing to attack the Jewish community itself.Here is the difficult truth: Legacy Jewish organizations will often tell you not to engage. They will insist that the concern is exaggerated. They will warn that raising the issue publicly will be divisive or counterproductive. They will counsel patience and quiet diplomacy.This approach has failed repeatedly.In 2022, when community members raised concerns about Byers in West Hollywood, several establishment figures insisted she was harmless. Some attacked those who raised alarms as divisive. The result: Byers won by 54 votes.Understanding why these organizations fail requires recognizing what they are and what they are not.Most local Jewish community infrastructure, such as Federations, Jewish Community Relations Councils and regional offices of the Anti-Defamation League, exists primarily to provide social services, facilitate interfaith dialogue and respond to incidents of Jew-hatred after they occur. They’re not built for political engagement. They lack the expertise, appetite, and, often, legal structure to intervene in electoral campaigns.When a Mamdani-type candidate emerges, these organizations default to their institutional comfort zone: convening conversations, issuing measured statements and hoping the problem resolves itself. Direct political confrontation is outside their operational DNA.Many mainstream Jewish organizations are led by professionals and board members who identify strongly with progressive movements. They see Jewish communal priorities, social justice, immigrant rights and LGBTQ+ inclusion as naturally aligned with the broader progressive coalition.This creates a structural blind spot. When a candidate emerges from progressive networks with troubling positions related to Israel, organizational leaders may view criticism as an attack on the coalition, rather than a defense of Jewish interests. They may choose to prioritize maintaining relationships with progressive allies over confronting a candidate who threatens the Jewish community specifically.The result is rationalization: the candidate’s views are “evolving,” the concerns are “exaggerated,” and engaging would be “divisive.” These organizations choose coalition comfort over communal protection.Some Jewish organizations believe that building relationships with problematic candidates will moderate their behavior once in office. They offer endorsements or refrain from criticism in exchange for promised “dialogue” or “access.”This is a losing trade. Mamdani-type candidates benefit from Jewish organizational cover during the campaign—the one moment when they are vulnerable—and face no accountability for policy development and implementation afterward.‘Do not be silent’Before raising public concerns, build a comprehensive record. Archive social-media posts, especially anything that may be deleted as a campaign approaches. Collect student newspaper articles, organizational newsletters and event announcements from the candidate’s campus years. Obtain disclosure forms via public records requests and cross-reference them against public statements. Screenshot LinkedIn profiles, organizational bios and conference speaker listings. Record public statements at candidate forums and community events.Documentation transforms suspicion into evidence. Without it, concerns are easily dismissed.The window for effective intervention is narrow. By the time concerns reach mainstream awareness, early voting may have begun. Raise issues publicly as soon as a candidate announces, not during the final weeks of a campaign.If a candidate lies about their history, say so with evidence. If they deny affiliations that appear on disclosure forms, publish the discrepancy. If institutions provide cover, name them and explain why their assurances should not be trusted.Silence creates the false impression that there is nothing to be concerned about. Do not be silent.Mamdani-type candidates do not rise alone. They benefit from endorsements, appointments and political cover provided by other officials. These enablers must face consequences for their role in advancing anti-Israel candidates.When a sitting official endorses a Mamdani-type candidate, they are lending their credibility to legitimize that candidate’s record. Track these endorsements. Make clear that endorsing candidates with anti-Israel, antisemitic backgrounds will be remembered and will affect future support, donations and endorsements in their own races.Silence is also a choice. When a Mamdani-type candidate emerges and elected officials who should know better refuse to speak up, they are prioritizing their own political comfort over their community’s well-being. Document which officials remained silent when it mattered. Their silence should be a factor in future electoral support.Some officials will acknowledge a candidate’s troubling background but urge voters to overlook it, arguing that the candidate has “evolved,” that the concerns are “overblown,” or that other issues are more important. This minimization is as damaging as outright endorsement. It provides cover while maintaining plausible deniability.The goal is to create a political cost for enabling Mamdani-type candidates. If officials know that endorsing, appointing, excusing, or staying silent about anti-Israel candidates will affect their own standing with pro-Israel voters and donors, they will calculate differently. Accountability must extend beyond the candidates themselves to the network that elevates them.If you are reading this article, you likely already suspect that something is wrong. A candidate in your community has a troubling background. You’ve raised concerns and been told to stand down. You’re uncertain whether to trust your instincts or defer to organizations with more experience and resources. Trust your instincts.The tactics documented here are not theoretical. They have succeeded in communities across the country. They succeed because concerned individuals are talked out of acting by institutions that prioritize comfort over confrontation.You do not need permission from legacy organizations to protect your community. You need documentation, coordination and the willingness to act before Election Day, not after.The warning signs are visible. The tactics are documented. The counter-strategies are clear. The next election is mere months away. The question is whether our communities will be ready.The postReading the political tea leaves and acting against dangerous candidatesappeared first onJNS.org.",

      "content": "Palestinians walk past the rubble of destroyed buildings, amid a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, in Jabalia, northern Gaza Strip, November 6, 2025. Photo: REUTERS/Mahmoud IssaAs the United States pushes for the second phase of President Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire to begin, Israel is warning that Qatar and Turkey are trying toshield Hamas from disarmamentas the Palestinian terrorist group seeks to reassert control over the war-torn enclave.Qatar and Turkey have proposed alternatives to a central provision of Trump’s peace plan, according to Israeli media reports. Rather than requiring Hamas to disarm, Qatari and Turkish officials have pushed for the Islamist group either to hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority or place them in secure storage under international oversight.As part of this plan, Qatar and Turkey are reportedlyadvocating a two‑year grace periodduring which Hamas could legally retain its weapons.However, Israeli officials have rejected these options as unacceptable, arguing they would allow the terrorist group to maintain its influence in Gaza, which Hamas has ruled for nearly two decades.Israel has made clear it will allow Hamas just a few months to give up its weapons, warning it will act unilaterally if the group is not disarmed promptly.Turkey and Qatar, both longtime backers of Hamas, have been trying toexpand their roles in Gaza’s post-war reconstruction,which experts have warned could potentially strengthen Hamas’s terrorist infrastructure.Israeli officials have repeatedly rejected any Turkish or Qatari involvement in post-war Gaza.The first stage of Trump’s peace plan, which took effect in October, includedHamas releasing all the remaining hostages, both living and deceased, who were kidnapped by Hamas-led Palestinian terrorists during their Oct. 7, 2023, invasion of and massacre across southern Israel. In exchange, Israel released thousands of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, including many convicted terrorists serving life sentences, and partially withdrew its military forces in Gazato a newly drawn “Yellow Line,” roughly dividing the enclave between east and west.Currently, the Israeli military controls 53 percent of Gaza’s territory, and Hamas has moved to reestablish control over the other 47 percent. However, the vast majority of the Gazan population is located in the Hamas-controlled half, where the Islamist group has been imposing a brutal crackdown.The second stage of the US plan is supposed to install an interim administrative authority — a so-called “technocratic government” —deploy an International Stabilization Force— a multinational force meant to take over security in Gaza — and begin the demilitarization of Hamas.As the international communityworks to implement phase twoof the ceasefire deal, Qatar and Turkey are now insisting that Israel must withdraw from Gaza before Hamas can disarm — a demand Jerusalem vehemently opposes, warning it would give the terrorist group time to reassert full control over its half of Gaza and remove any incentive to disarm later on.On Saturday, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said the international community has only achieved a “pause” in fighting,but not a full ceasefire, stressing that Israel would need to withdraw from the entire enclave to make it possible.“A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of the Israeli forces, there is stability back in Gaza [and] people can go in and out, which is not the case today,” Al Thani said during a press conference.The Qatari leader also said that the mediating countries, including Turkey, Egypt, and the US, are “getting together in order to force the way forward for the next phase.”However, Al Thani emphasized Qatar considers phase two to be “temporary,” arguing that addressing the immediate situation in Gaza alone is insufficient without tackling what he described as the underlying causes of the conflict.“This conflict is not only about Gaza, but also the West Bank. It’s about the rights of the Palestinians for their state,” he said. “We are hoping that we can work together with the US administration to achieve this vision.”According to the ceasefire plan, the Israeli army is required to withdraw further as the disarmament process unfolds. However, Israel has made clear that it will not pull backuntil Hamas disarms and other conditions are met.“We will not allow Hamas to reestablish itself. We have operational control over extensive parts of the Gaza Strip, and we will remain on those defense lines,” Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said on Sunday. “The Yellow Line is a new border line, serving as a forward defensive line for our communities and a line of operational activity.”Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said a credible Palestinian civil administration and a vetted, trained police force should be established before Hamas can disarm.In a press conference, Fidan emphasized that without these conditions, expecting Hamas to disarm is neither “realistic nor doable.”However, Hamas continues to reject full disarmament, saying the group is only open to storing or freezing its weapons in order to preserve “the Palestinians’ ability to defend themselves.”“Hamas is willing to discuss these ideas in the context of a ceasefire or long-term truce within a political process that will lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state,” senior Hamas official Basem Naim said in a statement.In Gaza,Hamas’s brutal crackdownhas continued to escalate dramatically as the terrorist group moves to reassert control over the enclave and consolidate its weakened position.Following the death of Yasser Abu Shabab, the leader of an armed anti-Hamas Palestinian faction, last week, Hamas has given militants a 10-day ultimatum to surrender in exchange for promises of amnesty, according to Israel’s Channel 12 and reports on social media.Abu Shabab, a Bedouin tribal leader based in Israeli-held Rafah in southern Gaza, had led one of the most prominent of several small anti-Hamas groups that emerged in the enclave during the war that began more than two years ago.Hedied last week while mediating an internal disputebetween families and groups within the militia, dealing a setback to Israeli efforts to support Gazan clans against the ruling Islamist group.Since the ceasefire took effect two months ago, Hamas has targeted Palestinians who it labeled as “lawbreakers and collaborators with Israel,” sparking widespread clashes and violence as the group moves to seize weapons and eliminate any opposition.Social media videos widely circulated online show Hamas members brutally beating Palestinians and carrying out public executions of alleged collaborators and rival militia members.",

Photo: Romain Costaseca / Hans Lucas via Reuters ConnectAn Algerian woman residing illegally in France is set to stand trial on Tuesday on antisemitism-aggravated charges after admitting to poisoning the food of the Jewish family that employed her as a nanny, in a case that has intensified public outrage amid asurge of antisemitic attacks across the country.The 42-year-old nanny, who has worked as a live-in caregiver for a family with three children aged two, five, and seven since November 2023, will now appear at the criminal court in Nanterre, just west of Paris, accused of poisoning them by contaminating their food and drinks with toxic substances, according to French media.She is expected to face multiple charges, including “administering a harmful substance that caused more than eight days of incapacity for racial or religious reasons.”The nanny, who has been living in France in violation of a deportation order issued in February 2024, is currently in custody and faces additional charges for presenting her employers with a forged Belgian identity document.The shocking incident, first reported byLe Parisien, in January last year occurred just two months after the caregiver was hired, when the mother discovered cleaning products in the wine she drank and suffered severe eye pain from using makeup remover that had been contaminated with a toxic substance, prompting her to call the police.After a series of forensic tests, investigators detected polyethylene glycol — a chemical commonly used in industrial and pharmaceutical products — along with other toxic substances in the food consumed by the family and their three children.According to court documents, these chemicals were described as “harmful, even corrosive, and capable of causing serious injuries to the digestive tract.”When the mother explained that only her family and the nanny had access to the house, she was promptly taken into police custody for questioning.Even though she initially denied the charges against her, the nanny later confessed to police that she had poured a soapy lotion into the family’s food as a warning because “they were disrespecting her.”“They have money and power, so I should never have worked for a Jewish woman — it only brought me trouble,” the nanny told the police. “I knew I could hurt them, but not enough to kill them.”According to her lawyer, Solange Marel, the nanny has withdrawn her confession, maintaining that there is no proof of an antisemitic motive and that jealousy and a perceived financial grievance were the primary factors.She also emphasized that the substances were found only in the parents’ drinks, not the children’s.Yonathan Arfi, president of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF) — the main representative body of French Jews — is set to appear before the court on Tuesday as a witness for the family.He described the case as “revealing of structural violence, whose singular severity should neither be minimized nor concealed.”",

Josh Shapiro have vowed to place K-12 antisemitism in Philadelphia public schools among its top priorities, citing rising incidents of hatred in schools across the city.“Governor Shapiro takes a back seat to no one on these issues, and as he has repeatedly spoken out about antisemitism, and this kind of hateful rhetoric is unacceptable and has no place in Pennsylvania — especially not in our classrooms,” Rosie Lapowsky, a spokesperson for Shapiro, said in a statement first shared with Fox News Digital. “This is a matter the governor has made clear the district needs to take very seriously.”Lapowsky’s comments come days after the US House Committee on Education and the Workforce beganinvestigating antisemitism in the School District of Philadelphia(SDP), as well as other districts in Virginia and California, following reports of antisemitic invective, bullying, and inciting language regarding the murders of two Israeli embassy staffers earlier this year.“Today, SDP employs numerous educators who allegedly promote antisemitic content in their classrooms,” education committee chairman Rep. Mark Wahlberg (R-MI) said in a letter to the district which announced the action. “One such teacher has allegedly threatened Jewish parents and students alone. She and other Philadelphia educators also allegedly use lessons from an effort called Teaching Palestine, whose class materials rationalize terrorist violence and advocate for the destruction of Israel.”He added, “In addition to failing to exercise oversight of antisemitic materials in the classroom, SDP’s partnerships with external organizations raise concerns about whether antisemitic ideology is being taught in Philadelphia schools.”In July, a bipartisan group ofPennsylvania state lawmakers called on Shapiroto intervene in what they described as a deepening crisis of antisemitism and political extremism within SDP.On Monday, Dr. Mika Hackner, director of research at the North American Values Institute, toldThe Algemeinerin a statement that antisemitic “rot” in SPD runs “deep” and that “changes have to be made.”“There is a very big problem in the School District of Philadelphia; not just with antisemitism but with extremism,” he said, citing “revelations of a private Signal chat in which teachers expose students to radical political actions like marches in support of Hamas or the idea that ‘all resistance is righteous.'”Jewish civil rights advocates have been clamoring for lawmakers to address K-12 antisemitism in schools in Philadelphia and throughout the state of Pennsylvania, as previously reported byThe Algemeiner.In July 2024, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) filed a civil rights complaint accusing SDP of allowing Jewish students to be subjected to a slew of antisemitic abuses. According to the complaint, antisemitic bullying at SDP is so severe that one Jewish student, after being told “f—k you and free Palestine” as well as “Praise Hitler,” left the school district entirely, according to the complaint. In another reported incident, an anti-Zionist student used the Halloween holiday to appear at school costumed as a terrorist and attempted to “drape a Palestinian flag over a Jewish student.” Their principal later allegedly “praised the costume.”Discriminatory behavior is also rampant in the classroom. However, the ADL charges, at SDP, teachers contribute to intimidation and shaming, using their power and monopoly on class discussions to denounce Israel as “exterminators” and stream videos accusing the Jewish state of “making Palestinians homeless.”Outside of Philadelphia, in Amber, Pennsylvania, the Wissahickon School District (WSD) ispresenting as fact an anti-Zionist accountof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to its K-12 students by using it as the basis for courses taken by honors students.“On May 14, 1948, Israel declared itself an independent nation: Based on a [United Nations] Mandate but not supported by other countries in the region; Recognized by the US and much of the non-Arab world; Expelled up to 750,000 Palestinians from their land, an event called ‘al-Nakba,'” says the material, provided by virtual learning platform Edgenuity, which implies that Israel is a settler-colonial state — a false assertion promoted by neo-Nazis and jihadist terror groups.“Nakba,” the Arabic term for “catastrophe,” isused by Palestinians and anti-Israel activiststo refer to the establishment of the modern state of Israel in 1948. Based on documents obtained byThe Algemeiner, the material does not seemingly detail the varied reasons for Palestinian Arabs leaving the nascent State of Israel at the time, including that they were encouraged by Arab leaders to flee their homes to make way for the invading Arab armies. Nor does it appear to explain that some 850,000 Jews were forced to flee or expelled from Middle Eastern and North African countries in the 20th century, especially in the aftermath of Israel’s declaring independence.Another module reviewed byThe Algemeinercontains a question based on a May 15, 1948, statement from The Arab League — a group of countries which adamantly opposed Jewish immigration to the region in the years leading up to the establishment of the State of Israel and refused to condemn antisemitic violence Arabs perpetrated against Jewish refugees — after Israel declared its independence. The passage denies that Jews faced antisemitic indignities when the land was administered by the Ottoman Empire, a notion that is inconsistent with the historical record, and asserts that “Arab inhabitants” are “the lawful owners of the country.”Wissahickon reemerged in the news cycle following reports that during a recent demonstration at Wissahickon High School a Muslim student group festooned signs which said, “Jerusalem is ours,” offered cash prizes related to anti-Israel activism, and swayed school principal, Dr. Lynne Blair, into being photographed with them, a feat which, according to concerns members of the community, created the impression that anti-Zionism is a viewpoint held by the administration.“Wissahickon leadership keeps insisting this was just a cultural event, but the community sees it for what it was — intimidation wrapped in keffiyehs and candy,” NAVI toldThe Algemeiner. “Even a blind squirrel occasionally trips over a nut, and in this case, the nut is the explosive reality that schools are no longer neutral grounds. When a superintendent publicly supports one side of a geopolitical conflict inside a public high school, it stops being education and starts being indoctrination. Jewish students deserve better, and every school district in America should take notice.”Follow Dion J. Pierre@DionJPierre.",

      "content": "Tucker Carlson speaks at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, Oct. 21, 2025. Photo: Gage Skidmore/ZUMA Press Wire via Reuters ConnectTheongoing foreign policy feudbetween US Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and anti-Israel podcaster Tucker Carlson continued over the weekend, with the legislator responding bluntly to the former Fox News host’s conduct and declarations at the Doha Forum in Qatar.In reply to Carlson’s announcement on Sunday that he intended to purchase a home in Doha and reports of anti-Israel sentiments at the event sponsored by the country’s ruling monarchy, Cruzasked, “I thought fellatio was illegal in Qatar?”Carlson had a sit-down discussion with Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani during the forum, during which the far-right media provocateur referenced widespread speculation that he was receiving Qatari money. Analysts have revealed in recent reports that Qatar, a longtime supporter of the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood’s global network more broadly, hasspent tens of billions of dollars to influenceUS policy making and public opinion in Doha’s favor.“I have been criticized as being a tool of Qatar, and I just want to say – which you already know – which is I have never taken anything from your country and don’t plan to,” Carlson said over the weekend. “I am, however, tomorrow buying a place in Qatar. I like the city; I think it’s beautiful. But also want to make a statement that I’m an American and a free man and I’ll be wherever I want to be. I have not taken any money from Qatar, but I have now given money to Qatar.”Carlson later confirmed his views of Qatar to the Doha News, saying that “I like it here a lot.” He previously told his fellow far-right podcaster Steve Bannon that “they know I’m not working for Qatar.”Cruz alsorespondedto an X post by Carlson’s longtime business partner Neil Patel which had tagged him and featured the podcaster extending a middle finger with the text, “Greetings from the booodthirsty, terror-supporting slave state of Qatar.”The senator affirmed the sarcastic taunt, writing, “Fact check: true.”Conservative talk radio host Mark Levin, also a frequent critic of Carlson who has previously deployed the epithet “Qatarlson,”wroteon Monday that “Neil Patel was top policy adviser to Dick Cheney. Tucker Carlson worked for Bill Kristol. Now they’re both monarchists — Qatar first lapdogs for a terrorist dictatorship.”The Al Thani family monarchy has run Qatar since the 1800s and has long supported the Muslim Brotherhood. The country hasprovidedthe Hamas-run government in Gaza with an estimated $1.8 billion and allows the terrorist group to host an office in Doha.The US State Department has affirmed severe human rights abuses in Qatar,including“enforced disappearance; arbitrary arrest; political prisoners; serious restrictions on free expression, including the existence of criminal libel laws; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of association, including overly restrictive laws on the organization, funding, or operation of nongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations; restrictions on freedom of movement; inability of citizens to change their government peacefully in free and fair elections; serious and unreasonable restrictions on political participation; extensive gender-based violence; existence of laws criminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct, which were not systematically enforced; and the prohibition of independent trade unions and significant or systematic restrictions on workers’ freedom of association.”US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) defended Carlson from Cruz’s criticism.“Canadian born Zionist Texas Senator Ted Cruz has lost his mind over Tucker Carlson,” GreenewroteSunday on X. “You would think a United States Senator would be gravely concerned about affordability for Americans, the looming healthcare crisis, and actually passing appropriations with another government funding deadline coming end of January. But instead he’s gone mad with Tucker living rent free in his head.”On Monday, Greenesharedgraphics on X critical of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (AIPAC) support for President Donald Trump, writing, “I AM AMERICA FIRST.  Thank you for your attention to this matter. -MTG.” One green image of a smiling, colorful Greene from “TrackAIPAC” affirms $0 in donations. This juxtaposes with a red image of a black and white, scowling Trump who has allegedly received over $230 million.AIPAC, a prominent American lobbying group, seeks to foster bipartisan support for a strong US-Israel alliance.In a Sunday interview with “60 Minutes,” Greene defended her decision not to vote for a measure condemning antisemitism,saying, “We don’t have to get on our knees and say it over and over again.”Mark Dubowitz, CEO at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies,reflectedon Carlson’s remarks in Doha by recalling the man’s father: “Watching Tucker in Doha, I think of Ambassador Richard W. Carlson — my former @FDD colleague and mentor. A true American patriot. A steadfast friend of Israel and the Jewish people. A fearless opponent of Islamists and Communists. May his memory be a blessing.”While many observers both within and outside the American political right haveexpressed concerns about increases in antisemitic sentiment, Vice President JD Vance pushed back on the claim over the weekend.“I think it’s kind of slanderous to say that the Republican Party, the conservative movement, is extremely antisemitic,” he said. “Do I think the Republican Party is substantially more antisemitic than it was 10 or 15 years ago? Absolutely not.”Vance, who employs one of Carlson’s sons in his office and is reportedly friends with the podcaster, added, “I just don’t see the simmering antisemitism that’s exploding that some people claim.”",

The political drawing depicts Hitler painting his version of “Deutsches Sud America” (“German South America”) which consists of a large swastika painted over the shape of South America. Photo: ProvidedAn exhibition that opened on Sunday in New York City spotlights the work of prolific Jewish Polish and anti-fascist artist Arthur Szyk, including scathing portrayals of the Nazis and his attention to themes such as Jewish identity, resistance, and Zionism.“Art of Freedom: The Life and Work of Arthur Szyk”opened at the Museum of Jewish Heritage –A Living Memorial to the Holocaust in Lower Manhattan on the anniversary of when the United States entered World War II. The exhibit in the museum’s Rita Lowenstein Gallery features over 100 objects, including original drawings, rare prints, illuminated manuscripts, commercial cartoons, and political materials. Visitors will have access to 18 never-before-seen pieces and 38 original artworks.Szyk’s work “Anti-Christ” from 1942, which is a critique of Adolf Hitler and Nazi crimes, greets visitors at the exhibit and is back on view in New York City for the first time in over 80 years. The artwork shows Nazi officials standing over skulls, victims on the gallows, vultures bearing swastikas, and Hitler with tiny skulls in his eyeballs as he stares straight ahead at the viewer.Also on view is “The Map Maker” (1942), a political drawing by Szyk that depicts Hitler painting his version of “Deutsches Sud America” (“German South America”), which is shown as a large swastika painted over the continent. Others stand around him — including Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and top Nazi officials Joseph Goebbels, Hermann Goering, and Heinrich Himmler — and they all want their own similar map.On the floor are folders that say, “Deutsches Europa,” Deutsches America,” “Deutsches Africa,” “Deutsches Australia,” illustrating the plan to have Nazism dominate the world.Also on the floor is a book titledIdiot’s Delightand a quote at the bottom of Szyk’s drawing says, “Now that you’ve joined us the Fuhrer will make a special map for you!”Szyk was borninŁódź in 1894 but moved to Paris at the age of 15 to study art. With other Polish-Jewish artists and writers, he traveled to the area now known as Israel in 1914, which was an impactful trip that deepened his connection to Judaism and solidified his dedication to being a lifelong Zionist advocate. Szyk died in 1951.First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote in her “My Day” newspaper column that Szyk’s work “fights the war against Hitlerism as truly as any of us who cannot actually be on the fighting fronts today.”“As an institution committed to educating visitors about Jewish life before, during, and after the Holocaust, we are thrilled to present Arthur Szyk’s exquisitely detailed and beautiful work, and to look back at his influential role inshaping public discourse around America’s pivotal entry into WWII,” said Jack Kliger, president & CEO of the Museum of Jewish Heritage.The new Szyk exhibit highlights pieces by Szyk that are on loan from private collections as well as newly acquired pieces from the museum’s permanent collection, which will be on view for the first time. The exhibit will remain open at the Museum of Jewish Heritage through July 26, 2026.",

      "content": "Hamas reportedly floated a longterm ceasefire of at least a decade paired with a formal commitment to halt the use of weapons under agreed guarantees.By United with Israel StaffSources within Hamas told the Saudi outletAsharq Al-Awsaton Monday that the group is engaged in what they described as increasingly serious internal discussions and contacts with regional mediators, alongside indirect exchanges with Israel.They said Hamas is awaiting confirmation from mediators on when indirect negotiations might resume, predicting this could happen late this month or early next month if the United States and Israel reach the necessary understandings.According to the report, Hamas is signaling willingness to consider a far-reaching arrangement that includes a 10-year ceasefire, a freeze on the use of weapons and the immediate transfer of civilian administration in Gaza to a technocratic body.In return, the group seeks the lifting of the blockade and firm assurances that Israel will not return to war.The newspaper said Hamas leaders held several rounds of talks with mediators in Doha, Cairo and Istanbul, with additional meetings already planned. The sources attributed the current momentum to strong American pressure and sustained regional mediation.They also reported growing convergence between Hamas, other Palestinian factions and Arab mediators over the possibility of transferring weapons to a Palestinian authority under strict conditions that would prevent them from reaching Israel or the United States, while ensuring a defined political process regarding the Palestinian issue. Hamas has reportedly floated a long-term ceasefire of at least a decade paired with a formal commitment to halt the use of weapons under agreed guarantees.Preparations are underway for an internal Palestinian meeting focused on governance arrangements for Gaza, administrative responsibility for the Strip and the future of armed groups. Senior officials from Fatah are expected to attend the planned gathering in Cairo.The discussions have also touched on ideas for an international stabilization force, including potential deployment and mandate. Hamas has reportedly indicated readiness to transfer administration of Gaza immediately to a technocratic committee within such a framework.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

Photo: REUTERS/Aziz TaherTheEuropean Union is studyingoptionsfor strengthening Lebanon’sInternalSecurityForcesto help free up the Lebanese army to focus on disarming the terrorist group Hezbollah, according to adocumentseen by Reuters on Monday.A 2024 truce between Lebanon and Israel remains fragile, with Israel carrying out regular strikes on Lebanese territory that itsaysare targeting Iran-backed Hezbollah’s efforts to rearm.Thedocument, produced by theEU’s diplomatic arm and circulated to the 27 member states, said it would pursue consultations with Lebanese authorities and that a scoping mission would take place in early 2026 on possible new assistance for the country’sInternalSecurityForces.EUefforts could “focus on advice, training and capacity-building,” the paper said, adding that the bloc would not take over the tasks of the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), whose mandate is set to expire at the end of 2026, when it is expected to begin a year-long drawdown and withdrawal.Instead, theEU “could contribute to the gradual transfer ofinternalsecuritytasks” from the Lebanese ArmedForcesto theInternalSecurityForces, allowing the army to focus on its core defense tasks, thedocumentsaid.The UN secretary general is expected to produce a transition plan in June 2026 that will address risks stemming from UNIFIL’s departure.EU, LEBANESE OFFICIALS TO MEET NEXT WEEKThe paper from theEuropean External Action Service comes ahead of a planned meeting between seniorEUand Lebanese officials in Brussels on Dec. 15.“Through a combination of advice, training and possibly the provision of certain equipment, the overall objective would be to enable the Police and the Gendarmerie to fulfil their mandates in cities and rural areas across the country,” it said, adding theEUcould also help Lebanon to better secure its land border with Syria.French President Emmanuel Macron’s special envoy on Lebanon, Jean-Yves Le Drian, was in Beirut on Monday to propose a roadmap that aims to assess independently Hezbollah’s disarmament, diplomatic sources said.Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said last week that Lebanon wanted to see a ceasefire monitoring mechanism play a more robust role in verifying Israel’s claims that Hezbollah is rearming as well as the work of the Lebanese army in dismantling the armed group’s infrastructure.Asked whether that meant Lebanon would accept US and French troops on the ground as part of a verification mechanism, Salam said, “of course.”",

The group seeks greater autonomy for the south, which was an independent state until unification with the north in 1990.The STC had participated under al-Alimi as part of the Presidential Leadership Council under the Saudi-led initiative to unify anti-Houthi factions. Tensions have persisted overcontrolof territory and forces.A UAE official told Reuters on Monday that the country’s position onYemen “is in line with Saudi Arabia in supporting a political process” based on Gulf-backed initiatives and UN resolutions. The official did not directly address the STC’s moves insouthernYemen.There was no word from Saudi Arabia, where the government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Al-Bidh said the STC reported limited resistance as Saudi-backed forces pulled back. Among provinces where the STC had advanced were Hadramout and Al-Mahra, which border Oman and Saudi Arabia and are key to trade and smuggling routes.Clashes occurred in Wadi Hadramout, while in Al-Mahra, local forces coordinated with the STC and there were no clashes, al-Bidh said.Another senior STC official said the group tookcontrolof Hadramout within 48 hours of launching the operation last week. He added Saudi forces withdrew from Perim Island in the Mandeb Strait, handingcontrolto the STC, and had left positions at the presidential palace in Aden.Yemen‘s civil war reached a stalemate in 2022. Recent calm had raised hopes of peace between the Houthis, whocontrolmost populated areas in the north, and the Saudi-backed government in the south.",

The signing follows Bolivia’s recent decision to cancel its visa requirement for Israeli travelers.According to Sa’ar, Israel is ready “to open a new chapter and fully restore diplomatic relations.” Bolivia’s president-elect has likewise told Jerusalem that he intends to reopen Bolivia to the world and rebuild ties with Israel.Israel was represented at November’s inauguration ceremony in La Paz by Foreign Ministry Director General Eden Bar-Tal.Bolivia and Israel first established relations in 1950, but ties deteriorated sharply after the far-left MAS party came to power in 2006. Under President Evo Morales, Bolivia severed relations in 2009 after Operation Cast Lead and aligned itself more closely with Iran.Relations briefly resumed in 2019 under the transitional government that replaced Morales, only to be cut again in October 2023 after Bolivia condemned Israel’s military actions in Gaza.With a new Bolivian government elected in 2025, both countries have moved quickly to reestablish political and diplomatic cooperation.Tuesday’s signing is expected to mark the formal restoration of full bilateral relations after more than a decade of instability.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

Israeli media have since reported that the two leaders may meet in Florida.The spokesperson’s comments came one day afterNetanyahusaid on Sunday that thesecondphaseof a USplanto end the war inGazawas close, but cautioned several key issues still needed to be resolved, including whether a multinational security force would be deployed.Netanyahu, speaking to reporters alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Jerusalem, said that he would hold importantdiscussions withTrumpat the end of themonthon how to ensure theplan‘ssecondphasewas achieved.Netanyahusaid that he woulddiscusswithTrumphow to bring an end to Hamas rule inGaza.

      "content": "New York City's mayor-electZohran Mamdanihas not yet taken office, but we've already seen a glimpse of what life can look like for Jewish New Yorkers. Several weeks ago, a pro-Palestinian mob protested outside Park East Synagogue in Manhattan, which was hosting an event by Nefesh B'Nefesh, an organization that supports North American Jews moving to Israel.Instead of condemning the mob for targeting a modern Orthodox synagogue, Mamdani's spokesperson, Dora Pekec, said, \"He believes every New Yorker should be free to enter a house of worship without intimidation,\" and added, \"And that these sacred spaces should not be used to promote activities in violation of international law.\"For a long time, I did not want to speak over Jewish New Yorkers who now have to live with a mayor who cannot condemn phrases like \"Globalize The Intifada.\" But I am tired of seeing bad-faith actors tell the worried Jewish community that their concerns are exaggerated, misinformed, or rooted in bad faith. Instead of confronting a record of statements and alliances that alarm many Jews, Mamdani and his defenders have chosen to tokenize Jewish voters and gaslight the community.An Orthodox Jewish man crosses the street during the New York City Marathon, Nov. 2, 2025, in New York (Photo: AP/Yuki Iwamura)Mamdani's defenders often point to the fact that a significant portion of Jewish New Yorkers voted for him, claiming this proves he cannot be antisemitic and that all allegations are about his stance on Israel. However, no poll accurately measures Jewish support. Most cite aCNNexit poll showing 31 percent support among 710 Jewish respondents, without methodology or margin of error disclosed.Another poll, conducted by Quinnipiac University, found only 16 percent of Jewish voters supported Mamdani, and 75 percent viewed him unfavorably.The real problem is not which poll is correct. It is the instrumentalization of Jews. Invoking Jewish voters when convenient and dismissing Jewish fears when inconvenient treats Jews not as a community with legitimate safety concerns, but as a rhetorical shield.If Mamdani wanted to reassure Jewish New Yorkers, his transition team selections did the opposite. Among the 400 appointees are several with documented histories of anti-Israel extremism or remarks crossing into antisemitism.Elle Bisgaard-Church, appointed as Chief of Staff, has deep ties to the Democratic Socialists of America, an anti-Israel movement known for supporting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel.Waleed Shahid, on the Committee on Community Organizing, wrote on October 7, while Israelis were still being murdered, that Hamas' massacre was a \"byproduct of Israel's violent policies.\" Contextualizing Jewish suffering in real time is not neutral; it is a moral failing.A pro-Palestinian demonstration in New York City, New York, USA, in August 2025 (Photo: Reuters)Jenna Hamed, on the Arts and Culture Committee, wrote six days after the massacre that she \"reaffirm[s]\" her people \"for all measures taken toward life and liberation\" and that \"freeing Palestine\" requires the \"obliteration of all borders.\" Given the context, this endorses violence and implies rejection of Israel's right to exist.Tamika Mallory, on the Community Safety Committee, has refused to condemn Louis Farrakhan, suggested Jews oppress people of color, and resigned from the Women's March in 2019 amid accusations of antisemitism. Elevating her to a role in community safety sends a chilling message about whose safety matters.These appointments are not incidental. They reflect a worldview that many Jewish New Yorkers already find alarming. Asking them to ignore that worldview because some voted for Mamdani is insulting.Jewish New Yorkers are not imagining things. They are responding to explicit statements, documented histories, and public choices made by their incoming mayor. Their concerns cannot be dismissed with selective polling or accusations of hysteria.If Mamdani wants to be a mayor for all New Yorkers, he must begin by acknowledging the legitimacy of Jewish concerns, not minimizing or manipulating them. He must be honest about the implications of his record and the rhetoric of those he elevates. Above all, he must stop allowing Jewish voters to be reduced to a talking point in the service of a political narrative.Gaslighting is not leadership. Tokenization is not inclusion.Jewish New Yorkers deserve better than both.The postTokenizing Jewish voters doesn't erase Mamdani's record of antisemitismappeared first onwww.israelhayom.com.",

      "content": "Because of the water’s high salinity and density, most plastic materials float and collect along the shoreline, creating a series of coastal terraces that document the type and quantity of waste reaching the basin each year.By Pesach Benson and Omer Novoselsky, TPSFor more than two decades, plastic waste carried from urban areas has quietly accumulated along the Dead Sea’s shrinking coastline, forming a striking visual and environmental record at the lowest point on Earth.A new study released Monday by the University of Haifa, in collaboration with Italian scientists, shows that flash floods, extreme salinity, and retreating water levels have combined to create a natural archive where plastic debris—including bags, toys, bottles, and even military equipment—remains trapped year after year, preserving a record of human activity in one of the world’s most extreme environments.Dr. Akos Kalman, Prof. Beverly Goodman Tchernov, and Prof. Michael Lazar toldThe Press Service of Israel, “The Dead Sea is not only a geoheritage site under threat, but it also functions as an accelerated natural laboratory for the rest of the world. Because it is a closed basin, everything that enters stays, which lets us follow the entire pathway of plastic pollution: from large pieces to fragments and finally to microplastics that become part of the geological record. What we see happening here now is likely to occur in many other water bodies in the future.”The Dead Sea, the world’s deepest hypersaline lake, has been losing water rapidly over recent decades.During winter, the Kidron Stream, which drains extensive urban areas in Jerusalem, carries sediments, debris, and plastics into the lake in short but powerful flash floods.Because of the water’s high salinity and density, most plastic materials float and collect along the shoreline, creating a series of coastal terraces that document the type and quantity of waste reaching the basin each year.Researchers have referred to these formations as “plastic rings,” highlighting both their striking visual impact and growing scientific value.The study—published in the peer-reviewedJournal of Hazardous Materials—systematically examined terraces formed between 2000 and 2021 at the junction of the Kidron Stream and the Dead Sea.The team collected all visible plastic items on each terrace and recorded their weights, types, abrasion levels, and spatial distribution.Sediment samples were analyzed for microplastics, which were separated, filtered, photographed under a microscope, and chemically examined to determine polymer types and the effects of prolonged exposure to sun, heat, and erosion.Historical aerial photographs and satellite images were also reviewed to track changes in coastal geomorphology and the stream’s flow over time.The analysis revealed a sharp increase in plastic input after 2000, with younger terraces containing hundreds of kilograms of waste.Projections indicate that by 2030, a single terrace could accumulate more than a ton of plastic.Exposure to intense sunlight and heat accelerates fragmentation, producing thousands of microplastic particles per kilogram of sediment each year.Researchers estimate that one kilogram of large visible plastic can generate roughly four thousand microplastic particles annually, many of which remain in the sediment and gradually integrate into the geological record.Some waste becomes trapped in sinkholes and cracks forming along the retreating coastline, embedding plastic in sediment layers and potentially creating a permanent archive of human activity.“When we arrived at the site, we saw not only a dramatic retreat of the coastline but also enormous amounts of plastic floating on the water’s surface. It was a jarring moment that made it clear how deep and severe the phenomenon is,” the scientists said.“Distinct plastic rings started forming around the Kidron outlet only about 25 years ago, after being completely absent before, and their growth since then is clear and steady. The amount of macroplastic entering the basin is so large that it provides the raw material for microplastic breakdown at a scale not documented elsewhere. What also surprised us is the sheer volume now accumulating and the fact that, despite growing public awareness, the problem continues to intensify rather than improve,” they toldTPS-IL.“Plastic pollution in the Dead Sea had not been fully recognized until now, and bringing attention to it is an essential first step. The most effective approach is prevention. This means identifying the exact sources and channels through which plastics enter the basin, increasing monitoring, and strengthening municipal waste collection, recycling, and public education. Regular surveys upstream can quickly reveal where the main leaks occur, and consistent enforcement of existing waste disposal laws would significantly reduce the flow of plastic before it reaches the Dead Sea,” they said.Inaction, they stressed, is not an option. “Without responsible management and guardianship, it will be lost. If nothing is done, plastic will continue to build up across the channels that feed the basin, just as we have already seen at the Kidron and other outlets. It will keep breaking into microplastics and spreading along the shoreline and coastal zone. In the worst case, the Dead Sea could become a polluted and hazardous environment that is difficult to access and may even affect products derived from it,” the scientists warnedTPS-IL.The Dead Sea, one of the saltiest bodies of water in the world, is a popular tourist destination.The water is about 9.6 times saltier than the ocean, creating its famous buoyancy, which allows people to float easily.The Dead Sea lies about 430 meters below sea level, making it the lowest point on Earth.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "The men and women of the IDF have proven to be the greatest generation of this era. They are worthy successors to King David and his mighty men.By Nils A. Haug,Gatestone InstituteWhen the Greatest Generation is mentioned, reference is invariably to those who went through the Great Depression and participated in the Second World War and who emerged victorious, at great personal cost, against various enemies bent on bringing America down.It may not be generally known that, immediately after WWII, as many as 48,000 volunteers, both Jews and non-Jews, from 59 nations arrived in Israel to fight for its independence. About 90% of Israel’s fledging Air Force pilots were new arrivals – the often-overlooked heroes of their time.The influence and virtues of those generations are “fading into permanent silence,” suggests political commentator Sean Patrick Calabria.“With each passing, we not only lose a life, but also a visceral link to the sacrifices that forged the free and prosperous world we inherited. We likewise take one step closer to forgetting their valor altogether, drifting towards the complacency they would warn us of. The result will inevitably be an America perilously blind to history’s hard-won lessons and too afraid or ill-prepared to confront the tyrants gathering anew.”In many Western countries, the present cohort of military-age young people generally seems to display an ignorance of integrity, the indispensable value of freedom of speech, Judeo-Christian values, and patriotism.Instead, despite having the comfort of food, shelter, advanced technology, and no military obligations, they appear to be self-absorbed and resentful of how extremely hard they supposedly have it. Destructive rather than creative, many appear, at best, disinclined to contribute meaningfully to the common good of the societies that provide them with so much.Is it possible that we are infantilizing them — depriving them of the most important education of all – by no longer requiring a military draft, a Peace Corps, or at least mandatory civilian national service to enable them to participate in “repairing” the world and seeing how most people actually live?Taking full advantage of the freedoms an open society offers – achieved by the courage and sacrifice of generations past – they misuse democracy and human rights. They support misogyny, terrorism masquerading as human rights, and silencing those with whom they disagree rather than respectfully hearing them out, a courtesy they seem to assume should be accorded only to them. Heterosexual white males, women competing in sports, and Jewish fellow citizens, specifically, are among those who suffer public denigration.The desperate years of World War II forged a steely character and strong work ethic. US Army Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds of Tennessee, for instance, was captured by German soldiers during WWII and incarcerated with thousands of fellow prisoners of war in Stalag IXA, a camp near Ziegenhain, Germany.As the highest-ranking POW at the camp, when the German camp commander ordered him to arrange that all Jewish POWs be assembled the following morning for transportation to concentration camps, Edmonds secretly arranged for all the inmates of the camp to assemble, not only the Jews among them. The next day, when the German officer saw the large gathering, he said to Edmonds “They cannot all be Jews.”Edmonds replied simply, “We are all Jews… If you shoot me, you will have to shoot all of us, and after the war you will be tried for war crimes.” The officer left. Many years later, in 2015, Edmonds, among many other heroes, was posthumously recognized by the State of Israel as “Righteous Among the Nations.”Almost every generation in history has a group of courageous men and women, of all ages, who deserve their place among the greatest and bravest of their time. The present cadre of Israeli warriors is no exception.The warrior spirit of early Israelites was evident as far back as 3,000 years ago. King David and his band of warriors formed their resolve in times of great hardship while gathered as outlaws in the caves of Adullam in Judea. Under David’s leadership, they became the mighty, the undefeated, preeminently heroic men of their age. These great fighters, exemplifying the continuing “spirit of Zion,” endure as role models to the soldiers of Israel today.It is these who have the world’s attention at present. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) battalion commander Lt. Col. Almog Rotem recalled of his soldiers’ actions in Gaza: “We’re in a grueling, challenging war. We fight shoulder-to-shoulder with our armored corps brethren and embrace them; throughout this war, their actions have saved dozens of soldiers’ lives. My heart goes out to the families of the fallen; we will embrace them and push forward to complete the mission.“I fight side-by-side with my troops; they possess remarkable mental and personal fortitude. They endure harsh experiences, but I see a glimmer in their eyes, their dedication, how they attack and never stop. Not a single soldier has said, ‘I don’t want to continue.'”Their jihadist enemies – relieved by vast international donations from having to concentrate on actually building their societies — were therefore free for years to focus on preparing for war. Instead of building great institutions and businesses, they used these financial windfalls to build “a city under a city”: 350-450 miles of tunnels used to protect the terrorists – not the Gazan civilians – and to store weapons and plan attacks.The Israelis were forced to engage enemies in close combat in dark tunnels full of deadly traps. The men and women of the IDF have proven to be the greatest generation of this era. They are worthy successors to King David and his mighty men. They are today’s “lions” of Israel.According to commentator Avi Abelow: “The TikTok generation in Israel, so often dismissed as distracted or disconnected, has proven itself to be made of the strongest steel. These young men and women, raised in the age of social media and short attention spans, are showing the world what true clarity and courage look like. They’re not confused by decades of failed appeasement or the lies of global media narratives. They know why we are fighting. They have seen with their own eyes the evil we are fighting against…. They are proving to be the true lions of Zion, standing with a strength and moral clarity that cuts through the noise…. they are the living, breathing spirit of Zion….”Journalist Jonathan Tobin notes that these men and women (many of them reservists who in everyday life work at everyday jobs) went on to defeat their “Iranian, Hezbollah and Hamas foes, and did so while still preserving [Israel’s] standards and humanity.” They are a credit to their people and to the Judeo-Christian ethos underpinning Western civilization itself.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "The lion figure stretches across about 1.5 dunams and rises roughly 13 meters.By Shula RosenAshkelon, a southern Israeli city, has opened a new attraction in Eco Park that city officials say is the largest playground structure anywhere in Israel – and possibly beyond,Ynetreports.The installation is built in the shape of a giant lion and is already drawing families who want to test its maze of tunnels, slides and climbing routes.The lion figure stretches across about 1.5 dunams and rises roughly 13 meters. Instead of one main path, the designers at Elu Et Nitzan scattered multiple routes throughout the structure so children can approach it from different points.The central tower is the highest spot, offering a lookout over the lake and nearby neighborhoods, and it connects to long tube slides that drop toward the lower levels.Kids can also slip out through the lion’s mouth or make their way across suspended nets that wrap around the tower.Seven tunnels form the lion’s mane, each built with its own mix of nets, ropes and climbing stones. They link into the tower at several levels.The front paws serve as a calmer space for younger children, with short slides, crawl areas and sensory panels designed to support early motor skills.The park also includes a wide range of accessible equipment. There are wheelchair-friendly carousels, sensory music stations, a musical sphere, a 360-degree swing and an accessible glider. A nest swing, an accessible chair swing and face-to-face seats hang from an arched frame that children can also climb.Older kids have their own features too, including a spinning carousel and a circular zip line.Shade is built into nearly every part of the structure, including the higher tunnels, and an internal lighting system makes the lion visible long after dark.Once an hour, the entire structure runs a short, coordinated light-and-sound display. Seating areas shaped like colorful triangles are spread around the site for families watching nearby.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "Women's representation inIDFcareer positions (permanent military service beyond mandatory conscription) has climbed seven percentage points over five years. As of 2024, women comprise one-third of all career soldiers, according to exclusive data obtained byIsrael Hayomthat Brig. Gen. Ela Shido Shachter, the gender affairs advisor to the chief of staff (the IDF's senior official responsible for gender integration policy), will present on Monday before the Knesset.The data reveals that female officers in the IDF have surged by nine percentage points over the past five years, with women now accounting for 36% of the officer corps.How has the officer landscape evolved?Female non-commissioned officers have similarly increased by five percentage points over five years, with women now representing 31% of all IDF NCOs.Moreover, despite an acute manpower crisis and the voluntary departure of hundreds of career personnel, soldiers are returning to service. The data shows nearly half of the 1,386 career personnel who rejoined the military are women.What patterns emerge from the data?Statistics spanning 2019-2024 demonstrate steady growth in women's representation across mid-level officer ranks, though substantial gaps persist at senior levels.Among second lieutenants and lieutenants, women's share rose from 41% in 2019 to 44% in 2024, while the captain rank saw an increase from 29% to 34%. More substantial advances occurred at the major rank, from 27% in 2019 to 33% in 2024, with the lieutenant colonel rank experiencing the sharpest jump, from 18% to 23%.Senior ranks tell a different story: Women's representation in the colonel rank climbed from nine percent to 14%, yet at the brigadier general level, it declined from eight percent in 2019 to merely five percent in 2024. At the major general rank, after one woman held this position in 2021 (7%), the number has remained negligible, hovering between 7 and 8% in recent years.The postWomen now comprise third of IDF's career officersappeared first onwww.israelhayom.com.",

Tamer Hassan, a senior official in Hamas’s Ministry of Finance, resides in Turkey and operates under the leadership of Khalil al-Hayya. Khalil Farawneh and Fareed Abu Dayer also act as money changers within the network, facilitating the movement of funds under Iranian guidance.Israeli authorities stressed that despite the devastation in Gaza, Hamas continues to pursue terrorist plots against Israel and is actively attempting to rebuild its capabilities, including through operations outside the Strip.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

That means Gaza will be fully demilitarized for the sake of Gazans.”By Akiva Van Koningsveld, JNSThe United States expects Hamas terrorists “to abide by the deal they signed,” a State Department spokesperson toldJNSon Sunday, after terror chief Khaled Mashaal appeared to reject key elements of U.S. President Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan a day earlier.“Hamas has agreed to all 20 points of President Trump’s 20 Point Plan. That means Gaza will be fully demilitarized for the sake of Gazans,” the spokesperson said in a statement emailed to JNS on Sunday afternoon.The statement came after Mashaal, during a speech at an anti-Israel summit in Istanbul on Saturday, rejected the U.S.- and U.N.-backed demands for Hamas to disarm and for the Strip to be demilitarized.“Protecting the resistance project and its weapons is the right of our people to defend themselves,” the terrorist said, while calling for the destruction of the State of Israel.“The resistance and its weapons are the honor and pride of the ummah [the Islamic nation],” Mashaal continued. “A thousand statements are not worth a single projectile of iron.”Mashaal in his taped speech also dismissed “all forms of guardianship, mandate and re-occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and all of Palestine,” rejecting another key part of Trump’s plan for Gaza, which received unanimous support of the U.N. Security Council on Nov. 17.The resolution implemented a mandate for Washington and partners to launch an International Stabilization Force and a Board of Peace, which will serve as a transitional government authority for the coastal enclave.The plan states that Hamas and other terrorists “agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form,” and that “all military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt.”According to the Nov. 17 Security Council resolution, the International Stabilization Force will be responsible for the process of demilitarizing the Strip, including “the destruction and prevention of rebuilding of the military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, as well as the permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups.”Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "Tehran cannot afford to lose the Houthis; they are the last viable vehicle for inflicting costs on the US and Israel that matter on a global scale.By Amine Ayoub,Middle East ForumThe assassination of a commander as senior as Haytham Ali Tabatabai—a man considered second only to Hezbollah’s Secretary-General in military command—is not merely a setback for the Lebanese group. It is a profound, perhaps fatal, crisis for Iran’s entire regional doctrine, the celebrated and feared “Axis of Resistance.”Tehran’s furious but purely rhetorical condemnation of the “cowardly assassination,” followed by the predictable and deafening lack of a direct, symmetrical response, sends a chilling message to its partners: You are expendable.The Islamic Republic’s strategy has always been a masterpiece of strategic ambiguity and risk management: project power, fight Israel and the United States, and bleed enemies dry, all without risking the homeland.Its proxies were the advanced guards, the ring of fire shielding the core.But the sustained, effective campaign of targeted strikes across Syria, Iraq, and now Lebanon has exposed the fundamental flaw in this doctrine.The Erosion of the Shield and the Rise of the SwordHezbollah has long been the gold standard of the proxy model, the jewel in Iran’s crown. It is highly trained, ideologically aligned, and geographically positioned on Israel’s border.The relentless attrition of its leadership, compounded by Iran’s non-intervention, confirms that, when push comes to a full-scale conflagration, Tehran’s priority is the regime’s survival over the lives of its most loyal allies.This failure creates a critical and dangerously volatile inflection point for the remaining, less-developed tentacles of the Axis, especially the Houthis in Yemen.Paradoxically, this strategic paralysis in Tehran does not necessarily mean abandonment for the Houthis. It means a terrifying promotion.Iran has suffered catastrophic strategic losses.With Hezbollah’s military command severely degraded and Iraqi militias often restrained by complex domestic politics, the Houthis in Yemen—who have demonstrated unique capabilities by disrupting global shipping in the vital Red Sea and launching long-range missiles deep into Israel—emerge as Iran’s most potent, intact, and geographically remote asset.Tehran cannot afford to lose the Houthis; they are the last viable vehicle for inflicting costs on the US and Israel that matter on a global scale.The result is that the Islamic Republic must and will increase its material support—drones, missiles, and expertise—to ensure this one remaining regional success story continues.The Autonomy Dividend and the Risk of RecklessnessUnlike Hezbollah, the Houthis have always maintained a greater degree of independent decision-making, driven by their own domestic political and religious imperatives in Yemen.They are not merely an expeditionary force; they are a deep-rooted civil war faction with an external agenda.Iran’s visible restraint in defending its closest proxy, Hezbollah, perversely strengthens the Houthis’ own narrative of autonomy.It allows them to continue their high-risk aggression in the Red Sea and against Israel—actions that often exceed Tehran’s own cautious risk tolerance—while still claiming the moral and material backing of the Islamic Republic.The Houthis understand that they are now the primary engine for Iran’s anti-Israel and anti-US posturing.This gives them immense leverage to demand resources while pursuing their own aggressive agenda. They are, in effect, now operating with a carte blanche from Tehran.If Iran refuses to retaliate for the killing of a top Hezbollah commander in Beirut, it signals to the Houthis that their own actions, however destabilizing, will likely be supported, as they represent the only remaining active front in the Axis.Iran is not cutting off its proxies; it is simply abandoning them to their fate once the price of defense becomes too high.The tragedy is that for an autonomous, aggressive group like the Houthis, this abandonment acts less like a deterrent and more like a twisted green light for escalation, transforming them from a strategic shield into an uncontrollable, high-risk weapon for their increasingly isolated and desperate benefactor.The silence from Tehran is not peace; it is the sound of a regional structure cracking, leaving the most radical components to fill the void.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

It is a reminder that the legacy of the Holocaust is not just about memory, but about a living security partnership with a Germany that openly accepts its historic responsibility to the Jewish people.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

They also called on parents to avoid sending sick children to schools and kindergartens to prevent infecting other children.The Health Ministry emphasized that the vaccine is safe, recommended for ages six months and up, and constitutes the most effective protection for the public.

The caregiver allegedly poured toxic cleaning products into food and drinks consumed by the family – parents and three young children from theParissuburbs – for several weeks.The case came to light in late January 2024 when the mother tasted cleaning products in the wine she was drinking. The evening before filing a police complaint, minutes after the caregiver left the house, she noticed foam on a bottle of grape juice and smelled bleach in the wine. Police seized cleaning products from the home, including a cleaning spray and a toilet cleaner containing bleach.The five-year-old daughter told her mother she saw the caregiver transfer soapy liquid into an alcohol bottle labeled \"Jerusalem.\"The case came to light in late January 2024 when the mother tasted cleaning products in the wine she was drinking (Photo: Getty Images)Getty ImagesLaboratory tests revealed chemical traces in wine stored at the home, in whisky, in grape juice, and even in pasta. According to the indictment, these are \"harmful and even corrosive substances that could cause serious injury to the digestive system.\"The caregiver, identified as Laila Y., 42, was arrested in early February 2024. She initially denied the allegations, but during a search of her home, she told officers, \"Because they have money and power, I should never have worked for a Jew, she only brought me problems.\"During interrogation, she confessed to pouring soap into the food as \"punishment\" and a \"warning\" following arguments about her wages. \"I was angry, they didn't respect me,\" she said. \"I knew this might cause them pain, but not enough to kill them.\"Her defense attorney claimed she retracted her confession and denies the antisemitic motive. According to the lawyer, the real motive was jealousy. \"What was said relates to a class issue and financial resentment,\" the attorney argued.According to the report, searches on the caregiver's phone included inquiries about the family's identity, about \"barbaric Jews\" and about Jewish religious customs. Her Facebook account contained posts related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The children testified that the caregiver asked them questions about religion, and the younger daughter said she saw her repeatedly strike the mezuzahs in the house.The family's attorneys view the acts as antisemitic crimes, and Jonathan Arfi, chairman of the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France (CRIF), has been invited to testify at the trial. Arfi said the affair \"exposes structural violence that must not be downplayed or ignored.\"The caregiver, who has been in custody since February 2024, was in France illegally and forged a Belgian identity document to obtain employment.The postAntisemitic caregiver accused of poisoning Jewish family in Franceappeared first onwww.israelhayom.com.",

      "content": "Key takeaways:Terror Was Honored as Journalism: Known Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives were publicly memorialized as “journalists,” erasing their violent actions.Propaganda Was Rewarded: Al Jazeera was granted a “press freedom” award despite documented ties to terror groups.Verification Was Abandoned: Tributes replaced fact-checking, turning unverified praise into narrative laundering.The Association and Club of Foreign Press Correspondents USA bestowed honors on some of America’s most distinguished journalists at its gala in Washington, DC, including veteran NBC journalist Andrea Mitchell.Yet the same organization also chose to bestow posthumous honors on individuals later exposed as active terrorists who had worked as “journalists” for Al Jazeera, the Qatari state broadcaster and a co-sponsor of the event. The channel itself was even awarded the association’s so-called “press freedom grant.”According to a dinner attendee, the ceremony included a moment of silence for 10 Al Jazeera reporters and media workers killed in Gaza while “covering the Palestinian conflict with Israel,” with their photos displayed at a memorial table – a disturbing imitation of the empty hostage tables used to honor Israelis kidnapped by Hamas.During the event, Fox News chief foreign correspondentTrey Yingstused his acceptance speech to eulogize Gazan reporters. He criticized Israel for restricting independent journalistic access to Gaza while omitting a crucial fact: Hamas routinely threatens, censors, and kills journalists, while selectively protecting cooperative reporters who comply with its messaging.Yingst praised the “fearless and tenacious Palestinian journalists in Gaza who don’t have the luxury to leave when reporting becomes too dangerous,” adding after applause: “May we not forget their sacrifice and contributions to our industry.”Since these “contributions” went unnamed, they deserve documenting.Western press have eaten up Al Jazeera *cough* Hamas propaganda over Anas al-Sharif’s elimination by the IDF.Here’s aof some of the most egregious coverage.https://t.co/zrgp91N4EP— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)August 12, 2025Anas Al-Sharif(killed on Aug 10, 2025)Intelligence materials recovered in Gaza, including training lists and salary records, identified Al-Sharif as the head of a Hamas terror cell responsible for rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and IDF troops. He was photographed with Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and other senior operatives. On October 7, he posted praise on Telegram for “heroes still roaming the country killing and capturing.”Ismail Al-Ghoul(killed on July 31, 2024)Identified as a member of Hamas’s Nukhba forces. According to the IDF, his military role included instructing operatives on filming terror attacks and participating in the production and dissemination of propaganda footage.Hossam Shabat(killed on March 24, 2025)Served as a sniper in Hamas’s Beit Hanoun Battalion. Hamas documents show his participation in formal military training as early as 2019. During the war, he carried out attacks against Israeli troops and civilians. As an Al Jazeera correspondent, he promoted a fabricated story accusing Israeli soldiers of gang-raping a pregnant woman at Shifa Hospital – a claim that Al Jazeera later quietly walked back.Hamza Al Dahdouh(killed on January 7, 2024)Recovered documents revealed he served in Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s electronic engineering unit and had previously been deputy commander of the Zeitoun Brigade’s rocket force. When killed, he was operating a drone that endangered Israeli forces.Mustafa Thuria(killed on January 7, 2024)Identified in Hamas documentation as a deputy squad commander in the Gaza City Brigade. He was killed in the same strike as Al Dahdouh during drone activity linked to military operations.Mohammed Salama(killed on August 25, 2025)Infiltrated Israel on October 7 and actively documented the terror assault. As OSINT researcher Eitan Fischberger noted: “Staging photos and videos while chanting ‘Allahu Akbar’ isn’t journalism – it’s active participation.”Recommended Reading:Media Ignore Evidence Showing Slain Gaza “Journalists” Were TerroristsBy memorializing known terror operatives and rewarding a propaganda outlet, the Association and Club of Foreign Press Correspondents USA transformed what should have been a celebration of journalistic integrity into a moral failure.This was not an act of solidarity with journalism – it was the elevation of militants masquerading as reporters.Liked this article?

      "content": "Naim added that Hamas retains its “right to resist,” but said the group is prepared to lay down its arms as part of a process aimed at leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state.By United with Israel StaffA senior Hamas figure abroad said the terror group is willing to discuss various arrangements for its weapons as part of the evolving ceasefire framework with Israel. Bassem Naim, a member of Hamas’ political bureau, toldThe Associated Pressthat the current pause in fighting must be treated strategically. “This time has to be used seriously and in a comprehensive way,” he said, adding that Hamas is “very open minded” about what to do with its weapons.“We can talk about freezing or storing or laying down, with the Palestinian guarantees, not to use it at all during this ceasefire time or truce,” he said. Naim added that Hamas retains its “right to resist,” but said the group is prepared to lay down its arms as part of a process aimed at leading to the establishment of a Palestinian state.Naim’s remarks come as both sides prepare to move into the second and more complicated stage of the agreement under negotiation.Earlier today, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is nearing the end of the first phase of its Gaza campaign while speaking alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “The first stage of the Gaza agreement is almost finished. We hope soon to move to the second stage, which is more difficult,” Netanyahu said. He also emphasized ongoing coordination with Washington. “I will speak with President Trump about the next stage in Gaza at my meeting with him at the end of the month,” he stated.President Trump has likewise indicated that progress is underway. When asked about the timing of phase two, he said, “Phase Two is moving along. It is going to happen pretty soon.”The comments from Netanyahu, Trump and senior Hamas officials highlight a pivotal moment, with discussions now shifting toward Hamas’ future military capabilities and Israel’s requirements for long-term security in Gaza.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "Troops opened fire, killing one terrorist, neutralizing another and arresting the third.By United with Israel StaffIDF Paratroopers from the 890th Battalion eliminated a Palestinian terrorist on Sunday during a planned operation near Azzun in the Ephraim Regional Brigade. The soldiers encountered three terrorists who were throwing stones at a major roadway, endangering Israeli drivers traveling through the area. Troops opened fire, killing one terrorist, neutralizing another and arresting the third. No Israeli forces were injured.The attack is only the latest in a surge of violence across Judea and Samaria.Last Tuesday morning, a stabbing attack took place at the entrance to the community of Ateret in the Binyamin region. A terrorist stabbed two Israelis before being shot by IDF soldiers who were already on site. Both victims sustained light wounds and were treated at the scene by Magen David Adom.Just days earlier, on Saturday night, another Israeli narrowly escaped death when a terrorist hurled an iron bar at a passing vehicle on Route 5 near the Palestinian village of Mas-ha, close to Elkana. The metal object pierced the windshield of Merav Ben Avraham’s car and miraculously missed her and anyone else who might have been inside.These incidents come amid intensified counterterror operations by the Israeli military. The IDF recently announced the completion of Operation “Five Stones,” a two-week campaign carried out by units from the Commando Brigade, Menashe Brigade, Shomron Brigade and the Air Force, together with the Shin Bet and Border Police.During the operation, Israeli forces killed six terrorists, arrested dozens of wanted suspects and questioned many others. Troops also seized hundreds of thousands of shekels intended for terror financing, along with dozens of weapons including pistols, M16 rifles, Carlo-type guns, ammunition and knives.The IDF stated that it will continue taking action against anyone who threatens the safety of Israeli civilians.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

According to planners, the expanded facility will significantly improve efficiency at Terminal 3 and bring the airport in line with international standards. The structure will also serve as the foundation for a future hotel, slated to be built on the eastern rooftop level to serve travelers directly from the terminal.Construction is expected to take about 30 months from the start date and will be carried out within the operating terminal in full coordination with the Israel Airports Authority to ensure uninterrupted service.The development strengthens Ben-Gurion Airport’s readiness for growing demand and helps ensure the continued smooth functioning of Israel’s primary international gateway.Ron Rekach, Director of National Licensing at the Planning Administration, said, “Advancing the permit for the HBS structure is an important step in strengthening Ben-Gurion’s operational capabilities and preparing for increased passenger traffic. It is also an excellent example of dual-use planning, with a hotel to be built above the structure to serve the terminal.

      "content": "Beyond cognitive gains, many said the group format helped them feel understood and supported, providing emotional validation and a sense of community that eased the isolation often experienced after cancer treatment.By Pesach Benson, TPSFor many adults recovering from cancer, finishing treatment does not mean the end of challenges.Subtle but disruptive changes in memory, attention, and mental processing—often called “chemobrain”—can make work, relationships, and everyday routines unexpectedly difficult.A new study offers hope that a remote, group-based cognitive rehabilitation program can help survivors regain confidence, improve daily functioning, and feel less alone in the process.The intervention combines cognitive training exercises with occupational-therapy–based strategies and weekly group sessions conducted entirely online.In the pilot study, a small group of adults participated in six weekly meetings and engaged in personalized digital brain-training activities.Participants reported noticeable improvements in their ability to manage everyday tasks, from organizing work projects to handling household responsibilities.Beyond cognitive gains, many said the group format helped them feel understood and supported, providing emotional validation and a sense of community that eased the isolation often experienced after cancer treatment.The remote, online format allowed participants to join from home, making it easier to fit the program into their daily routines.Its digital, group-based design also makes the intervention scalable, offering the potential to reach a larger number of survivors without the logistical challenges of in-person programs.“Cancer survivors often tell us they feel like they’ve ‘lost’ parts of themselves after treatment,” said Prof. Yafit Gilboa, the principal investigator of the study.“Our goal was to offer a practical, compassionate, and accessible way to help them regain control—to show them that their cognitive challenges are real, understandable, and, importantly, treatable. Seeing participants improve in the activities that matter most to them is exactly why we do this work.”While improvements in objective cognitive tests were modest—common in research on cancer-related cognitive impairment—most participants reported meaningful gains in self-perceived cognitive functioning.The program, known as CRAFT-G (Cognitive Retraining and Functional Treatment – Group version), was developed by researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Based on these promising early results, the team concludes that the approach is both feasible and potentially effective.They recommend larger trials to further validate its benefits, and a new study is already underway focusing on breast cancer survivors.The research, published in Supportive Care in Cancer under the title “Remote group intervention for adults with cancer-related cognitive impairment: a feasibility study,” highlights the potential of online, group-based interventions to help survivors manage the cognitive effects of cancer treatment and reclaim their daily lives.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

By employing sweeping accusations, emotional imagery, and anonymous sources, CNN reaches a predetermined conclusion that Israel was purposefully targeting innocent aid-seeking Palestinians.1/CNN didn’t publish an investigation – they published a lesson in how to spot media misinformation.Easy checklist: emotional images, sweeping accusations, anonymous sources, no hard proof.Case study: CNN’s “bulldozed corpses & mass graves” story on Israel.pic.twitter.com/tRzBWT4ofK— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)December 6, 2025The investigation claims there was “regular Israeli gunfire toward aid seekers this summer,” alleging that such fire resulted in the deaths of numerous Palestinians. What CNN omits is that throughout the aid distribution period, Hamas repeatedly worked toundermine humanitarian operationsby obstructing access to aid routes and sites. When disorder and dangerous crowding ensued, the IDF fired warning shots in accordance with established protocol. Still, throughout the piece, CNN blames any and every death on “indiscriminate Israeli fire,” ignoring the well-evidenced role of Hamas in creating chaotic and dangerous conditions.The@UNsays Gaza needs 600 aid trucks a day.What they aren’t saying?

Moreover, CNN fails to note that aid distribution operations frequently proceeded without incident, successfully delivering humanitarian assistance to thousands of Palestinians – facts that undermine the article’s sweeping and one-sided conclusions.The investigation goes on to claim that “the Israeli military has repeatedly buried the bodies of Palestinians into unmarked, shallow or mass graves in locations across Gaza,” including at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, citing other CNN reports to reinforce the allegation. In doing so, CNN relies on a circular sourcing model, using its own prior articles as evidence rather than independently verified findings.View this post on InstagramA post shared by HonestReporting (@honestreporting)What CNN conspicuously omits is that it was Hamas, not the IDF, that haddugthose graves before Israeli forces entered the area. Multiple reports throughout 2024 documented that Hamas and the Hamas-affiliated Civil Defense excavated mass graves near hospitals to bury people who had died in the hospital and could not be transferred elsewhere. Additional bodies of Palestinians whom Hamas and other terrorist organizations executed, or terrorists who died fighting the IDF in these areas, were likely added to those sites.Recommended Reading:Unearthing the Story Behind the Gazan Mass GravesCNN’s conclusions are drawn almost entirely from anonymous or Hamas-linked sources, including the Hamas-run Civil Defense. CNN has previouslyinterviewedthe Civil Defense spokesman, who is directlyaffiliated with Hamas.Other anonymous sources include IDF soldiers fromBreaking the Silence, an organization with a well-established anti-Israel agenda that allegedly has produced “fabricated or exaggerated” testimonies. The CNN investigation does not provide any further information regarding the units or dates of any interviewee, making corroborating evidence impossible to source.This fits a broader pattern: when CNN cites “experts,” it routinely offers no evidence to corroborate their claims. Janina Dill, co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict, for example, asserted that the IDF violated international law through alleged mishandling of bodies. Yet CNN provided no proof to support the claim, and no evidence has been presented that the IDF engaged in any such conduct.To describe CNN’s piece as an “investigation” is misleading. Real investigations are grounded in independently verified evidence, transparent sourcing, and rigorous contextual analysis. This article offered none of that. Instead, it leaned heavily on anonymous or Hamas-linked sources, excluded critical facts, and reached conclusions before establishing proof — substituting narrative framing for journalism.Accountable reporting requires adherence to basic media standards. CNN has repeatedly demonstrated that it is less interested in meeting those standards than in advancing predetermined storylines – building narratives first and fitting facts afterward.Liked this article?

They smashed the window here and stole the phone from inside,” he said. “But you know what? Everything is fine, thank God. You have to look at the glass half full.”He added that even this frustrating incident reminds him how far he has come. “Thank you that what I am dealing with now is going to the police station to file a complaint, and not being in the tunnels thinking about what I need to eat now and whether they will bring me food. So thank you that this is what I have to deal with. It is not fun, but it is more interesting. So thank God that this is what I have to deal with.”Kupershtein’s reaction reflects the mindset he has embraced since his release from Gaza. Before traveling to Washington last month to meet President Donald Trump, he toldCNN, “I prefer to take things with humor and laughter, to be happy with my family, and to look forward, not back.”His resilience is the same spirit that kept him helping others on October 7, 2023, when he stayed at the Nova Music Festival to evacuate wounded partygoers. He had made several rescue runs and was returning yet again to aid more victims when he was shot and kidnapped by Hamas. Despite everything he endured during captivity, he has said he would make the same choice again.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "“They had a state in Gaza, and they tried to destroy the only Jewish state. Therefore, Israel will not establish a state that will be committed to its destruction.”By United with Israel StaffPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz held a joint press conference on Sunday, presenting coordination on Israel’s military goals in Gaza while also revealing clear differences over the question of Palestinian statehood.Netanyahu said that Israel is nearing the close of the initial phase of its Gaza campaign. “The first stage of the Gaza agreement is almost finished. We hope soon to move to the second stage, which is more difficult,” he said.Netanyahu also noted that he plans to raise the issue with President Donald Trump during their upcoming meeting. “I will speak with President Trump about the next stage in Gaza at my meeting with him at the end of the month,” he said.Standing beside him, Chancellor Merz affirmed Germany’s support for Israel’s security while stressing the expectation that Israel operate within legal frameworks. “We stand alongside Israel, but it must stand by international laws,” he said.A central point of disagreement between the two leaders was the question of a two-state solution. Merz stated, “I support an outlook for two states.”Netanyahu rejected that approach, citing Israel’s experience after withdrawing from Gaza. “They had a state in Gaza, and they tried to destroy the only Jewish state. Therefore, Israel will not establish a state that will be committed to its destruction,” he said.Diplomatic protocol also surfaced during the press conference when a German journalist asked why Merz had not extended an invitation to Netanyahu to visit Berlin. Merz answered that it had not been discussed and that “there is no reason to talk about this now. When the time comes, I will propose it.”Netanyahu replied that he would be pleased to visit Germany again, but he pointed to the obstacle created by legal actions abroad. “I would be happy to come to Germany again. The reason we are not coming there is because there is an arrest warrant against me and against the defense minister by the prosecutor at the court in The Hague.”The press appearance reflected both the deep strategic ties between Jerusalem and Berlin and the sharp policy differences that remain. While the two leaders presented a united front on Israel’s security needs and the next phase of the Gaza campaign, their contrasting positions on the creation of a Palestinian state continue to define a central divide. For Merz, it represents a necessary political horizon, while for Netanyahu, it remains an unacceptable risk that Israel cannot afford after the Gaza experience.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "Key Takeaways:The Guardian’s hit piece on Rep. Ritchie Torres uses manipulative framing to portray pro-Israel advocacy as politically suspect, masking a broader anti-Zionist campaign as ordinary “grassroots” criticism.Jewish safety and support for Israel are subtly recast as indulgent or out of touch, with The Guardian blurring unrelated economic issues to delegitimize concerns about antisemitism and terrorism.Through selective sourcing, rhetoric, and editorial sleight of hand, The Guardian manufactures narratives that normalize anti-Zionist hostility, granting extremist positions a veneer of mainstream legitimacy.While much attention is focused on the missteps ofThe New York Timesand theBBC, the real yeoman’s work of advancing the anti-Zionist narrative is being done elsewhere: quietly, steadily, and with devastating effectiveness by The Guardian.Its recenthit pieceon Congressman Ritchie Torres exemplifies this approach.What masquerades as political reporting is, in reality, narrative engineering – aesthetic journalism that substitutes analysis for framing and fact for insinuation. The unsettling part is how persuasive it feels to readers unfamiliar with the mechanics of media manipulation.Let’s examine how it works.The article’s headline performs a classic sleight of hand. It suggests Torres “came under fire for his support of Israel,” yet reframes the controversy as a debate over affordability – subtly implying that Jewish safety concerns (and those who prioritize them) are somehow incompatible with caring about the American working class.In effect, the framing poses a false choice:Care about Jews, or care about people.This is provocation masquerading as reporting.The truth—that Torres is facing backlash from an ideologically driven anti-Zionist movement—isn’t stated plainly because it would expose the narrative. Instead, the article recasts a targeted political campaign as an organic populist awakening.And so, rather than confronting the uncomfortable reality of escalating antisemitism in progressive politics, The Guardian repackages the story into a faux-populist scolding:“Americans struggling financially…”“Grassroots activists challenging establishment Democrats…”“Questions of moral leadership…”“Shifts in public sentiment…”This is not a neutral analysis.It is a smoke machine.A small, ideologically aligned network of Democratic Socialists of America activists is presented as a sweeping “grassroots” groundswell – while Torres, a Democrat representing a heavily Jewish, Black, and Latino district, is cast as out of step with the people he serves.Woven throughout is a familiar historic maneuver: portraying Jewish concerns as privileged distractions from “real problems.” Support for Israel, the world’s only Jewish state and refuge for an endangered people, is depicted as a luxury issue—indulgent at best, selfish at worst—in the midst of economic hardship.Let’s be clear:Jews are not causing the affordability crisis. Israel has nothing to do with rising rents or interest rates.These are entirely separate realities.The Guardian blurs them anyway.More disturbing still is how easily the article normalizes the rhetorical excesses of anti-Zionist activism – deploying words like “genocide,” “colonialism,” and “occupation” as routine political vocabulary while stripping them of legal or moral seriousness.In this framework, extreme accusations become everyday slogans—weapons, not arguments—aimed at Jews who dare to assert the right to survival and self-defense.The result is a carefully constructed worldview in which:Support for Jewish safety becomes suspicious.Moral clarity becomes controversial.Political safety requires silence.This is how antisemitism spreads today – not only through chants and mob violence, but through polished prose and editorial aesthetics. Through the sanding down of hostility until it looks like “debate.” Through institutional language that pretends to be neutral while laundering hatred into legitimacy.The Guardian isn’t merely covering a political race.It is shaping the terrain on which Jewish safety is politically contested.And when Jewish survival becomes the battlefield, euphemism transforms into weaponry.If Torres were facing attacks for defending any other vulnerable minority, the moral stakes would be obvious, and the framing would be fair. But when the target is Jewish safety,  context suddenly appears. Excuses emerge. Extremism is rebranded as activism.What is handed to the global anti-Zionist movement is invaluable: a veneer of legitimacy, a mainstream platform, and implied permission to escalate.This is the most dangerous function of media failure:These stories do not merely misreport antisemitism.They manufacture the conditions for it to thrive.And the world is reading.Liked this article?

      "content": "The bullet passed through the tissue between the heart’s septa – the inner walls separating its chambers.By Shula RosenIsraeli surgeons at Haifa’s Rambam Medical Center removed a soldier from immediate danger after a bullet pierced his chest during an IDF raid in Syria and came to rest inside his heart,The Times of Israelreported.The soldier was flown in on a military helicopter in grave condition and is now recovering in intensive care.Prof. Gil Bolotin, head of Rambam’s Cardiothoracic Surgery Department, said that time was of the essence when the medical team realized the bullet had penetrated the protective vest and had stopped inside the heart.Bolotin toldThe Times of Israelthat surgery was complex and challenging and involved opening the chest from both side to side and the center to stop the bleeding.He was one of two troops badly hurt in the same overnight operation in southern Syria. Both arrived in critical shape and were rushed directly from the landing pad to emergency surgery for severe gunshot wounds, according to Rambam.The bullet passed through the tissue between the heart’s septa, the inner walls separating its chambers.Once the surgeons evaluated the damage, they decided against taking it out immediately.Bolotin explained that the team may eventually remove it through another operation or by catheterization, though it could also be left in place. He said the soldier is already recovering and alert.The condition of the two soldiers has since improved, and they are described as stable but still under close observation.The two wounded soldiers were among six troops injured during an IDF mission in the Syrian village of Beit Jinn, around seven kilometers east of the Israeli border.The army said the raid sought to arrest two brothers from the al-Jama’a al-Islamiyya terror organization, who were believed to be planning attacks and had previously fired rockets at Israel.Troops detained the suspects at home, then came under fire as they withdrew.Soldiers returned fire, while helicopters, drones and fighter jets struck hostile positions the IDF said had been prepared in advance as targets.The IDF has maintained a presence at nine positions in southern Syria for nearly a year, most of them inside a UN-patrolled buffer zone, and says its forces operate up to 15 kilometers inside the country to prevent weapons from reaching hostile groups on Israel’s border.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "The move will bring many more officers under strict device controls and eliminate Android phones from all military communication channels.By Shula RosenThe Israel Defense Forces is preparing to expand its iPhone-only policy across a wider segment of its command structure, tightening digital security rules that were reassessed after the October 7 attack, Army Radio reported.The move will bring many more officers under strict device controls and eliminate Android phones from all military communication channels.For more than a decade, senior commanders at the level of colonel and above have carried only military-issued iPhones.The policy began after the army halted the distribution of Android models, concluding that Apple’s closed operating system carried a lower risk of penetration attempts or unauthorized access.According to the latest review, that approach will now be applied far more broadly.The most immediate change involves rank. Restrictions that once applied only to the uppermost echelon will now take effect beginning at lieutenant colonel, adding what Army Radio described as “hundreds” of officers to the list of personnel barred from using non-Apple devices for official communication.Those affected will be issued new equipment as the transition is phased in.The second adjustment is more sweeping: The IDF is expected to formally prohibit the use of any military phone that is not an iPhone.Under the emerging directive, Android devices may still be used privately, but they will be excluded altogether from encrypted operational channels, internal coordination, and any communication involving classified material.The decision follows months of internal discussions about data exposure and lessons drawn from the breaches that allowed hostile groups to monitor troop movements and intercept sensitive information in the early stages of last year’s war.Security officials concluded that narrowing the range of permitted devices would improve the army’s ability to manage vulnerabilities and keep all officers on a uniform platform.Implementation is expected to begin once updated guidelines are circulated, making Apple’s iPhone the sole device allowed for military communication across the IDF’s senior and mid-level ranks.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "“We must prepare for a scenario like October 7 there, which could erupt at any moment.”By United with Israel StaffIsraeli forces in Hebron on Saturday night stopped a Palestinian car-ramming attack at the Police Circle, where a terrorist attempted to run down an IDF foot patrol.The soldiers immediately opened fire and killed the attacker. One Israeli soldier was lightly injured.The IDF spokesperson stated that “a short while ago, two terrorists accelerated their vehicle toward forces of the Paratroopers Brigade, who were on an operational mission at a police checkpoint in the Yehuda Regional Brigade. The forces fired at the terrorists and eliminated them.” A later update confirmed that an uninvolved civilian at the scene was also hit.This marked the second attempted vehicle attack in the area in less than a week. Last Monday, a female soldier was lightly wounded when another terrorist rammed his vehicle into her. She was evacuated for treatment, and after hours of searching, the assailant was located and killed by the 202nd Paratroopers Battalion after attempting yet again to ram troops pursuing him.A senior Israeli security official expressed deep concern about the broader situation in Judea and Samaria. Speaking toChannel 14 News, he said, “Judea and Samaria is the arena that worries us the most. We are not strong enough there in intelligence. We will still encounter the weapons that entered the area during the war. We must prepare for a scenario like October 7 there, which could erupt at any moment.”The latest attack came shortly after the IDF wrapped up a major counterterror mission in northern Samaria. Over two weeks, Israeli forces eliminated several terrorists, arrested numerous wanted suspects and seized large amounts of cash and weapons intended for future attacks. More than 30 targeted strikes were carried out under Operation Five Stones, designed to prevent terror networks from rebuilding.Keep Israeli Soldiers Warm - Send Winter Jackets!We are honored to thank the young men and women of the IDF who risk their lives every day to defend the citizens of Israel.Join us in sendingwinter care packagesand personal notes of support to Israeli soldiers who are out in the cold all day.Warm up a soldier's heart with essential winter wear including fleece jackets, hats, gloves and more.

      "content": "Key Takeaways:Hamas’ Khaled Meshaal openly rejected core elements of Trump’s Gaza peace plan, including disarmament and relinquishing control.No major Western outlet reported his speech, leaving policymakers and the public unaware of Hamas’s real intentions.Expert analysis says Meshaal’s remarks reveal Hamas’ unfiltered worldview, including calls that echo the logic of another October 7.Two years after Hamas’s horrific massacre in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and barely two months after the terror group agreed to the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump’sGaza peace plan, Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal delivered an unfiltered message in Arabic: no disarmament, no relinquishing rule of Gaza, no acceptance of any international authority, and a renewed commitment to Israel’s annihilation.Yet not a single major Western news outlet reported the speech.Meshaal’s comments were delivered remotely in Arabic at a conference in Istanbul titled “The Commitment to Jerusalem.” According to experts, his statements were not rhetorical flourishes. They were a clear repudiation of the peace plan Hamas supposedly accepted.And the silence surrounding them is staggering.Hamas in Its Own WordsThe speech directly contradicted the commitments Hamas has agreed to or said it would consider under the US-brokered ceasefire deal: disarmament, transfer of Gaza governance to an external body, and cessation of hostilities.Meshaal instead declared: “The time has come for the nation to decide on the liberation of Jerusalem as a symbol of the liberation of Palestine, the cleansing of the Al-Aqsa Mosque… And Gaza, which started ‘Al-Aqsa flood’ in 2023 and turned into the pride of the nation and the conscience of nations, this mighty Gaza deserves more from us.”On the ceasefire itself, he dismissed it outright: “Yes, two months ago, a ceasefire was announced, but the war is not over.”He called for “rejecting all forms of guardianship, mandate, and occupation over Gaza, over the West Bank, and over all of Palestine.”And on rearming, he was very clear: “The resistance project and its weapons must be protected. It is the right of our people to defend themselves. The resistance and its weapons are the honor and strength of the nation.”According to researcher Idit Bar, who specializes in the Arab and Islamic world, Meshaal’s words amount to a strategic declaration: “Meshaal, one of Hamas’ prominent leaders, says here very clearly, he puts all the cards on the table: No to disarmament, no to relinquishing Hamas’ rule, yes to the annihilation of Israel, yes to the liberation of Jerusalem. He even uses the term ‘cleansing’ al-Aqsa from impure Jews.”Bar added: “He also calls for the release of prisoners, which he calls captives, from the Israeli prison, which is literally a call to kidnap hostages, because he saw on October 7 that it’s worthwhile. As far as he is concerned, between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, there’s space for only one state, an Islamic state, clean of Jews. That’s why he says the war isn’t over.”What’s Behind the Media SilenceThere are only two explanations for the omission: a lack of Arabic-speaking reporters or bias.But major news organizations do have Arabic-speaking reporters across the Middle East. They could understand Meshaal’s words. They would have known he was speaking — it was all over Arabic social media feeds, andAl-Jazeeracovered it. They should have reported it.Which only leaves the second option as a viable explanation: those “reporters” chose not to publish what they knew. It was easy to hide that choice from editors who do not speak the language. And when newsworthy events or statements go unreported, they effectively cease to exist for the public record.The bias is all the more striking becauseAFPhad a reporter covering the conference, yet chose to highlight only the more moderate remarks of Gaza Hamas leader Khalil al-Hayya, who claimed the group would accept governance by a UN force. The agency even sought clarification from Hayya, who—knowing his comments would be quoted in English—added that Hamas would disarm only if the “occupation” ended. Meshaal’s far more explicit rejection of disarmament and peace was omitted entirely.Media outlets have committed a journalistic sin – a manipulation of reality. Meshaal’s speech was a rare glimpse into Hamas’s true intentions: unfiltered, unambiguous, and damning. It contradicted diplomatic assumptions, exposed the fragility of the ceasefire, and signaled preparations for future violence.But Western audiences, including policymakers, never heard a word about it.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:Qatar’s alleged 2024–2025 influencer trips remain unverified, but they align closely with Qatar’s documented method of using curated access, high-level meetings and foreign-agent intermediaries like Joey Allaham and Nicolas Muzin to target conservative, pro-Israel and Jewish networks.Qatar’s broader soft-power campaign is active and well-funded — using lobbying, hospitality, media partnerships and digital influence operations to normalize the emirate, soften scrutiny of its ties to Islamist movements and reshape Western narratives about Gaza and the Middle East.Despite criminalizing dissent and tightly controlling its own press, Qatar is expanding its footprint in Western media spaces, including CNN’s new Doha studio, raising concerns about transparency, editorial independence and the ease with which authoritarian states can influence public discourse.In recent months,allegationshave circulated that conservative influencers have been taken on curated trips to Qatar. These claims remain unverified, but they do not exist in isolation. Qatar has spent years cultivating influence among pro-Israel, Jewish and conservative networks in the United States. The real story is not a handful of influencers posting selfies in Doha. It is the sustained, well-resourced strategy behind these efforts.So beautiful can’t wait to come backpic.twitter.com/Z7DQICsHq7— emilysavesamerica (@emilysavesusa)November 30, 2025Qatar’s goal seems clear. It wants to normalize itself in Western public discourse, soften criticism of its ties to Islamist movements, and present the Emirate as a progressive, indispensable actor in the Middle East. Whether through paid lobbying, curated hospitality, tailored access or media partnerships, Qatar has demonstrated its willingness to invest heavily to reshape how it is perceived.At the same time, Qatar is a heavily restricted media environment. Independent journalism is suppressed. Criticism of the government is criminalized. Yet Western media increasingly frame Qatar as an attractive destination for culture, technology and innovation. That disconnect is not accidental. It has been engineered.My first trip to Qatar has been eye-opening. This is a very different Middle East than I experienced as a U.S. Army soldier deployed during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Long before I was a political commentator, media personality, and podcaster, I was a United States soldier tasked…pic.twitter.com/NyGbuPgAg3— Rob Smith (@robsmithonline)December 1, 2025What We Know: Qatar’s Influence Operations Have a Clear PrecedentAny discussion of alleged influencer trips should begin with what is already documented. The clearest precedents involve Joey Allaham and Nicolas Muzin, whose activities between 2017 and 2018 reveal exactly how Qatar identifies and targets influential American networks.Joey Allaham, a New York restaurateur and political fundraiser, became a central intermediary in Qatar’s outreach to American Jewish leaders, conservative donors, and pro-Israel influencers. He was engaged by the Qatar-linked firm Bluefort Public Relations to conduct “community engagement,” and later retroactively registered under the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA disclosures confirm that he received approximately $1.45 million. He organized high-profile trips to Doha, coordinated meetings with senior officials, including members of the ruling family, and helped Qatar access individuals who shape U.S. debates on Israel and the Middle East. This was not tourism. It was targeted ideological outreach.A similar pattern emerged withNicolas Muzin, a former senior adviser to Ted Cruz, who was hired by Qatar in 2017. Muzin and his firm, Stonington Strategies, registered as foreign agents, with contracts worth several million dollars over multiple reporting periods. His work focused explicitly on improving Qatar’s image during its regional crisis and facilitating access to influential conservative, Republican, and pro-Israel figures.Taken together, Allaham and Muzin provide a blueprint for Qatar’s method: identify key voices, fly them to Doha, offer curated access, and attempt to reshape their understanding of the emirate. This history matters because it shows that Qatar’s outreach to conservative and pro-Israel figures is not speculative. It is documented, deliberate, and embedded in a broader soft-power strategy. The alleged 2024–2025 “influencer trips” remain unverified, but they align with this established architecture.The Present Moment: A Renewed Soft-Power CampaignEven without any publicly verified evidence of new “influencer delegations,” Qatar’s influence-building strategy appears to be ongoing. For example, a widely shared post onXrecently accused Qatar of “trying to control every member of Congress.” While that specific allegation remains unverified, it nonetheless gained traction — precisely because it resonates with what observers already know about Qatar’s long-term efforts to shape U.S. politics and institutions.Recent analysis by theJerusalem Institute for Strategy and Securityhas noted a noticeable increase in pro-Qatar messaging and digital content operations aimed at reshaping narratives about Gaza, Israel, and Qatar’s role as a broker. There are allegations that a pro-Qatar online influence network exists, using fabricated news sites and synthetic social-media personas. These details remain allegations, but they mirror practices exposed in previous years.Qatar’s normalization does not rely solely on political outreach. It is increasingly embedded in Western media landscapes. In 2025,CNNopened a new studio in Doha, located in Media City Qatar. The launch was accompanied by a new CNN International program highlighting culture, lifestyle, and trends, with Qatar providing infrastructure and technical support. Critics warn that such arrangements risk softening editorial independence, especially given Qatar’s persistent ranking as one of the least free media environments in the world, as documented by theCommittee to Protect Journalists.This is not unique to CNN. It is part of Qatar’s sustained effort to integrate itself into Western cultural and media ecosystems while maintaining strict censorship at home.The issue is not whether influencers posted flattering photos from Doha. The concern is the strategic, well-financed effort by a repressive state to reshape Western public discourse. Qatar’s influence operations target political actors, campus activists, Jewish communal leaders, conservative donors, journalists, and now potentially social-media influencers. Qatar understands that narrative and legitimacy are forms of power, and it is willing to invest heavily to secure both.There is currently no public documentation confirming a 2024–2025 conservative influencer delegation. Until such evidence emerges, these claims must be treated cautiously. But Qatar’s broader strategy is neither speculative nor new. The documented activities of Joey Allaham and Nicolas Muzin demonstrate precisely how Qatar has operated in the past, who it targets, and why these networks matter.Qatar’s soft-power project is real, well-funded, and ongoing. And it raises serious questions about transparency, the integrity of political and media ecosystems, and the ease with which authoritarian states can reshape Western debates.[/sc]",

      "content": "Key Takeaways:The New York Times published multiple columns portraying Israel as an aggressor while ignoring that Israel’s actions in Lebanon, Syria, and Gaza are defensive responses to ongoing terrorist threats and repeated ceasefire violations.Roger Cohen and Ben Rhodes advance misleading claims — from downplaying Hezbollah operatives to spreading debunked quotes and antisemitic tropes about Jewish political influence — all while erasing Hamas’ role in driving the conflict.Both columns rely on distortions of Israeli policy and the laws of war to paint Israel as imperialistic, while overlooking Israel’s preventative counterterror measures, low civilian-combatant ratios, and strict adherence to international law compared to Hamas.If you are looking for accurate, bias-free reporting on Israel, it’s no secret that The New York Times isnot the place to go. Two columns in only the space of a few days, spreading similar dishonest reporting, is indicative of the Gray Lady’s agenda.On November 30, The New York Times published the headline “‘Imperial Israel’ in the New Middle East” in Katrin Bennhold’s newsletter. In the newsletter, she included the column “Israel’s military dominance” by Roger Cohen. Then, the following day, it published “This Is the Story of How the Democrats Blew It on Gaza,” by Ben Rhodes.Both stories are filled with outright lies that seek to portray Israel as the aggressor in the region.Does Israel Have Imperial Motives?From reading “The World” newsletter, one would certainly think Israel is motivated by its desire to capture more territories. This is not only contrary to Israel fighting wars of self-defense throughout its history, but is also contrary to the nature of the conflicts the country finds itself in the midst of today.When terrorist organizations don’t abide by the ceasefire, the media, including The New York Times, has consistently turned a blind eye, excusing or downplaying the violation.“It has become a pattern,” Katrin Bennhold unironically writes. She is correct; it has become a pattern of dishonest, inaccurate reporting whereby Israel is branded as taking “imperialistic actions” when, in reality, it is taking defensive actions against terrorism and terrorist infrastructure, as it has recently in Syria and Lebanon.Opened my inbox to find this shameless click-bait from@nytimes. It refers to Israel’s policy after October 7 to stop deterring the terrorist armies on its borders—and start removing them, killing terrorists nearly anywhere.Needless to say, that is not what imperialism means.pic.twitter.com/cIQp8Qu9uz— Eylon Levy (@EylonALevy)December 1, 2025The world stood in shock after the terrorist attacks of October 7, which left thousands of Israelis dead or injured. Israel, understandably, changed its counter-terrorism doctrine in real time to actively counter every threat before the terrorists could act on their plans.In his column, Roger Cohen claims that Israel is currently targeting “less prominent Hezbollah members.” Yet some of these members, portrayed as unimportant, includeHaytham Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah’s Chief of General Staff,as well as numerous local representatives who have been working on rebuilding Hezbollah’s infrastructure in southern Lebanon.While Cohen correctly notes Hezbollah is currently a “shadow of its former self,” Israel cannot afford to allow Hezbollah to reconstruct its military capabilities unchallenged. The notion that these operatives are less prominent ignores the reality that every member of Hezbollah plays a critical role in restoring the group’s terror network. Israel’s precision strikes prevent Hezbollah from rebuilding the very infrastructure that threatens Israeli civilians.Recommended Reading:What the Media Don’t Explain About Israel’s Fight With HezbollahThe IDF has similarly carried outpreventative operationsin Syria to ensure the safety of the northern border of Israel.Israel has thus proved this “military dominance” that Cohen writes about, particularly for that reason: preventative action. Unless Israel wants to see another mass terrorist attack, the army will continue to maintain its dominance over terrorist threats while ensuring the safety of civilians in any country, as has been the framework and foundation of the IDF. While peace is Israel’s ultimate goal, until terrorist groups adhere to the ceasefire and the threat is dismantled, peace will remain a distant illusion.A Distorted Picture of the Israel-Hamas WarBen Rhodes’s “This Is the Story of How the Democrats Blew It on Gaza” is meant to read as a critique of the Democratic Party’s policies on Israel over the two years following Hamas’ terrorist attacks. It could have been an interesting analysis of how U.S. policies impact Israel’s war strategy. Instead, it was just a hit piece deploying standard antisemitic tropes, all the while claiming that the charge of antisemitism is being leveled “so broadly.”No one is suggesting that critiquing the policies of Israel’s government is antisemitic. But when Rhodes suggests that American politics are “beholden” to AIPAC money, he utilizes the trope of Jewish funds being used to assert dominance over American politics.In the same vein, Rhodes quips that Democrats who side with Israel over Hamas feel like “hypocrites when defending a ‘rules-based order,’ racial equality and democracy.” Supporting Israel, a democratic state fighting a terrorist organization that explicitly violates every rule-based order, is entirely consistent with those values.Rhodes: Siding with Israel over Hamas was hypocritical for Dems defending a “rules-based order,” racial equality & democracy.Huh? What does backing Isr have to do with *racial equality*?And Isr is a democracy fighting Hamas – the least democratic entity one could imagine.3/11— Lazar Berman (@Lazar_Berman)December 1, 2025Nonetheless, Israel did not enjoy “unconditional support” from the U.S. as Rhodes claims. Otherwise, Israel would not have listened to the U.S. when it originally told the IDF to stay out ofRafah, despite Israel knowing that it was not only a terrorist stronghold, but also where hostages were being held.Rhodes does not critique the Israeli government in his piece. He does, however, spread the lie that former Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant called Palestinians “human animals” and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to Gaza as an “evil city.” Palestinians were never referred to as “human animals,” and Netanyahu specifically referred to Hamas operating in Gaza, making it a “wicked city.”In today’s@nytimespiece@brhodeslies about quotes by Israeli leaders, proving the weakness of the “genocide” case. Gallant never called Palestinians “human animals” and Bibi cited “Hamas” in reference to the “wicked city.” Rhodes lies like all “experts” on this matter. 1/2pic.twitter.com/U3Ld3mB84V— Aizenberg (@Aizenberg55)December 1, 2025Although Rhodes notes that “Hamas has engaged in abhorrent acts of terrorism,” it is caveated by claiming that Israel had no right to drop “2,000-pound U.S.-made bombs on refugee camps full of children.” He correctly asserts that no state has the right to target civilians indiscriminately. What he omits, however, is that Israel explicitly targeted terrorists who embedded themselves in civilian infrastructure, and the IDF employed extensive measures to prevent civilian casualties. For that reason, thecivilian-combatant ratio of less than 2:1remains one of the lowest in modern warfare.All of these claims are said to assist Rhodes in concluding, based on a faulty U.N. report, that Israel is committing genocide. But again, the facts speak for themselves, and neither the casualty figures nor the intent to commit genocide support this conclusion.Recommended Reading:Rebutted: UN Inquiry Report Falsely Accuses Israel of “Genocide”The laws of war are clear, and it is all the more clear that Israel has been adhering to them throughout the war. In the rare cases where individual IDF soldiers violated these requirements, they have been investigated. Hamas, by contrast, has never adhered to these laws – not before October 7, not during the atrocities, and not in the aftermath. Of course, that is to be expected from a terrorist organization.Yet, Rhodes makes the absurd moral equivalence between the two, suggesting that if someone believes a “Palestinian child is equal in dignity and worth to an Israeli or American child,” they can no longer support Israel. However, a child kidnapped and brutally murdered by terrorists and a child tragically used as a human shield by Hamas and caught in the crossfire do not have the same perpetrators. Recognizing the equal worth of all children does not require erasing the moral distinction between those who target them and those who try to protect them.Rhodes is thus no different from Cohen in attempting to portray Israel as an aggressive, territory-seeking entity that acts with impunity. This is an unfortunate paradox, considering Israel is fighting terrorist organizations that will never be held to the same standards.Two articles. Two days. One outcome: distorted and biased commentary on Israel that does not reflect the reality of the war against terrorist organizations it has been fighting for over two years.But sadly, this is precisely what we’ve come to expect from the opinion pages of The New York Times.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:Drone footage from Gaza is far from objective — operators strategically manipulate angles, altitude, lighting, and cropping to exaggerate destruction and exclude functioning areas, creating a distorted narrative of total devastation.Civilians, including children, are repeatedly placed in hazardous rubble zones for staged photo-ops, raising serious questions about who organizes these scenes and how they are used to manufacture sympathy and reinforce anti-Israel messaging.The imagery systematically omits critical context, such as intact neighborhoods, functioning infrastructure, and the role of Hamas’ tunnel network — turning drone visuals into powerful propaganda tools rather than neutral documentation.Drone footage has become the most influential visual currency of the Gaza conflict.It appears authoritative.It appears neutral.It appears to reveal the whole picture.In reality, no other form of imagery in this war is more operator-controlled or more editorially shaped than the aerial frame.From altitude to angle, from cropping to color, from the timing of flights to the deliberate exclusion of surrounding normality, Gaza drone footage is built through a visual language that most viewers never notice.What looks like objective documentation is often a constructed emotional product designed to communicate devastation, despair or accusation. The drone shows not what is, but what the operator chooses to show and what the publishing outlet decides to amplify.This investigation challenges the myth of drone objectivity.It shows how aerial images become narrative weapons, shaping perceptions of Gaza by technical choices that are anything but neutral.⸻1.Forensic AnalysisThis aerial image shows long communal Iftar tables placed in a narrow corridor of rubble inside the Nuseirat refugee camp. The tables form a straight geometric line through a destroyed streetscape. Multiple surrounding structures show partial collapse, compromised floors, and exposed rebar.Communal Iftar tables arranged inside a narrow rubble corridor in Nuseirat. The mid-high drone angle keeps the devastation dominant while concealing the wider area. The staging places civilians within a structurally hazardous zone, raising questions about access, coordination, and purpose.The location selected for the meal is not neutral. It requires civilians, including women, children, and elderly individuals, to enter and remain within an active risk zone:Structurally unstable buildings flank the scene.Debris fields contain sharp metal, concrete fragments, and potential unexploded hazards.Access roads into the area appear narrow or blocked, indicating controlled entry.The positioning raises serious questions about who authorized access, why this exact corridor was chosen, and how hundreds of civilians were moved in and out of a high-risk environment. Nothing in the frame suggests an organic public gathering. The layout is too orderly, too symmetrical, and too logistically engineered, given the surrounding instability.Photographic Technique AnalysisThe photographer employs multiple construction strategies:Mid to high altitude framingReinforces the impression of total devastation while preventing visibility of safer or alternative areas outside the cropped corridor.Directed symmetryThe straight Iftar line produces an intentionally theatrical contrast, ritual foregrounded against curated ruin.Edge croppingThe drone is positioned so that viewers cannot assess safe exits or wider functioning zones; only the tight slice of devastation is shown.Gray sky timingChoosing an overcast moment removes color warmth and increases the perceived severity of the environment.Human density as an emotional scaleCrowded tables amplify the perceived proximity between civilians and structural danger.Risk and Access LogicThe scene cannot occur without:Pre-cleared access routes into a hazardous zonePermission from the controlling authorityLogistical staging, including tables, chairs, sound systems, and signageCrowd movement coordination and exit planning in an active conflict environmentThe image, therefore, documents not only an Iftar, but the deliberate placement of civilians into a high-risk environment for photographic effect.⸻2.Forensic AnalysisThis image shows a long communal Iftar table arranged through the center of a devastated street in Gaza City’s al Shujaiyya neighborhood. The scene is framed from a high elevated point to emphasize the scale of destruction surrounding the gathering.A long communal Iftar table is positioned through the center of a destroyed street in al Shujaiyya. Families gather in a structurally dangerous zone while collapsed buildings and loose rubble surround them. The elevated framing and deep focus emphasize devastation and raise questions about safety, staging and controlled access.Large sections of the street remain uneven, unstable, and littered with debris. Access to this location requires navigating collapsed structures, loose rubble, and sharp concrete fragments. People in high-visibility vests appear at several points along the table, suggesting coordinated staging, crowd control, or logistical management.While the caption presents the scene as a community resuming religious rituals among the ruins, the visual reality highlights that this is an active war zone environment, not a safe civic space. The placement of families inside a structurally dangerous corridor of destroyed buildings raises questions about who determined the location and under what level of compulsion or direction.Photographic Technique AnalysisThe photographer uses a high downward angle to create a dramatic linear composition. The long table becomes a visual spine cutting through the rubble. This angle maximizes the vertical walls of destruction around the gathering.Additional techniques visible in the frame include:Symmetrical framing of the table to imply collective unity and resolveForeground rubble and mid-ground diners layered together to reinforce a narrative of resilience set against devastationExtended depth of field that keeps both the table and the damaged buildings sharply in focus so that destruction dominates the emotional readingA subtle bias toward gray tonal values, whether natural or graded, which enhances bleakness and contrast with the more colorful vests and tableclothsThis is a carefully crafted visual message. The community is small compared with the vastness of destruction surrounding it.Risk and Access LogicThis location is visibly hazardous. The vertical slabs, fractured flooring, and loose debris fields suggest a structurally compromised zone with potential for collapse, dust inhalation or secondary injuries. Bringing civilians, including children, into such an environment for a communal meal would not occur organically.This raises three critical questions:1. Who arranged the access and gathering point?Natural civilian movement rarely flows into the most structurally dangerous corridor of a destroyed neighborhood.2. Were participants instructed or encouraged to assemble here?The synchronized table layout and number of people indicate planning and coordination.3. Was the photographer granted exclusive safe passage?High vantage point shots require controlled access and operational permission, especially in a rubble zone.These factors align with known Gaza media control patterns. Access is facilitated when the resulting imagery benefits narrative objectives.⸻3.Forensic AnalysisTwo aerial images show several hundred schoolchildren arranged in tightly controlled formations outside temporary tent classrooms positioned beside Harun al Rashid School. The drone altitude is deliberately low to mid, giving visual weight to the children in the foreground.Aerial images show students arranged in precise formations beside tent classrooms, while captions describe harsh conditions, the warm lighting, controlled staging, and hazardous location suggest a curated scene designed for emotional impact rather than a natural depiction of daily schooling.The shaped lines of pupils, forming curves and parallel bands, indicate intentional arrangement rather than spontaneous movement. Their symmetrical positioning reinforces a narrative of education amid devastation, using visual order to heighten emotional contrast.From a photographic perspective:The downward camera angle of roughly 35 to 45 degrees ensures rubble dominates the frame, while undamaged areas outside the scene are excluded.Strong midday sun and clear shadows reveal warm and stable conditions rather than the harsh weather often implied in captions.Tent classrooms, some branded with UNICEF, are centrally placed to reinforce symbolic cues of dependency and crisis.The safety contradiction is stark. Hundreds of children are positioned in an active war-damaged zone that would normally be restricted because of structural instability and unexploded ordnance risk.The combined effect signals a visually engineered scene, organized, symmetrical, and highly photogenic, yet set in a location that would typically be considered too dangerous for schooling. These two images serve as strong evidence of drone-based narrative construction, not neutral documentation.⸻4.Forensic AnalysisThis aerial image shows Yarmouk Stadium, once used for sports and public events, now filled with temporary shelters. The caption presents the scene as a humanitarian consequence of two years of Israeli attacks, yet the photograph also reveals critical contextual elements that the caption does not mention.A drone image of Yarmouk Stadium shows it filled with tents and framed symmetrically to maximize the impression of mass displacement. Vehicles visible at the bottom of the frame indicate functional access routes and some degree of operational infrastructure, contradicting the caption’s implication of complete isolation from services. The framing omits neighboring functioning streets and intact buildings and reinforces a visual narrative of total collapse that the wider environment does not support.From a photographic forensic perspective:The drone is flown at a mid elevation, not high altitude, allowing the operator to compress the stadium interior and prevent adjacent functioning streets from diluting the narrative.The framing is deliberately symmetrical and centered on the oval interior, reinforcing the idea of a sealed, contained humanitarian crisis.The surrounding buildings appear partially intact, but the frame excludes many of the functioning structures immediately around the stadium. The chosen angle ensures that the tents fill the visual field and amplify scale.The stadium is accessible only through controlled entry points, meaning the people inside had to be moved into an exposed zone in an active conflict environment, a central inconsistency never addressed in captions.The overall color balance leans toward cool and desaturated tones, which heighten the emotional interpretation of bleakness.From a narrative standpoint, this is a constructed visual assertion, not a complete documentary truth. The image emphasizes mass displacement while concealing the operational context. Tents placed inside an exposed stadium in a live conflict zone raise questions about who organized it, why this site was chosen, and whether civilians were directed into a structurally unsafe location.The caption’s claim of “harsh conditions without access to water, electricity or sanitation services” is not supported by the visual evidence.Visible vehicles and widespread mobile phone use contradict the notion of total infrastructural collapse.⸻5.Forensic AnalysisThis drone image looks north along Gaza City’s coastline. The caption describes the scene as Gaza’s former tourist coast that has now turned into a shelter for the homeless. That wording directly clashes with years of international coverage and NGO rhetoric that framed Gaza as the world’s largest open-air prison or a concentration camp long before the current war. It cannot simultaneously have been a tourist coastline and a prison. The caption quietly rewrites the past to heighten the emotional impact of the present.A medium altitude drone view of Gaza City’s coastal strip, with tents and temporary shelters set between damaged and partly intact buildings. The caption rebrands the area as a former tourist coast, contradicting years of coverage that portrayed Gaza as an open-air prison, and uses a narrow corridor of shoreline to stand in for the entire city.Visually, the drone is flown at medium-high altitude and pitched at a shallow diagonal, creating a sweeping recession from the dense and damaged foreground to the pale strip of beach and sea. The composition forces the viewer to read a single narrow corridor of destruction and tents as representative of the entire coastline.Clusters of tents and temporary structures are visible close to the beach, set among both damaged and partially intact concrete buildings. The frame excludes most of the inland urban area and any functioning infrastructure beyond this corridor. That selective exclusion is the key photographic choice. The viewer is never allowed to see what lies just outside the lens, only this carefully curated band of ruined tourist coast that serves the narrative of total transformation and loss.⸻6.Forensic AnalysisThis aerial image shows the area around the Rashad Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City. The building and its surroundings are damaged, while temporary shelters fill the open space around it. The visual message is deliberate. This is not an anonymous structure. It is presented as a cultural landmark now surrounded by displaced families.The Rashad Shawa Cultural Center is presented as a long-standing hub for exhibitions, festivals, and conferences that now shelters displaced Palestinians, reinforcing a highly emotive narrative and exposing a clear contradiction with earlier claims that Gaza functioned solely as an open-air prison.The caption stresses that the center has for many years hosted exhibitions, festivals, conferences, and public panels. That wording is carefully chosen. By highlighting the building’s cultural history, the photograph invites the viewer to see the damage as an attack on civilian life, education, and culture rather than as one site among many in a wider conflict.This fits a clear pattern in the drone series. Editors repeatedly choose emotionally loaded civic locations, including schools, stadiums, a former tourist coastline, and now a cultural center. Each is selected because it already carries symbolic weight in the viewer’s mind. The choice of subject does as much work as the damage itself.There is also a deeper contradiction exposed by this caption. For years before the war, Gaza was widely described in international media and NGO campaigns as an open-air prison with little freedom of movement or normal public life. Yet the same caption now describes a venue that regularly hosted exhibitions, festivals, conferences, and discussion panels. Both framings cannot be true at the same time. The drone photograph, therefore, does more than show rubble. It quietly reveals how narratives are adjusted to suit the emotional needs of the moment.From a visual standpoint, the drone height and angle compress the damaged buildings, tents, and dense urban grid into a flattened field. This makes it difficult for the viewer to separate what is temporary from what is permanent, or what is severely damaged from what is still standing. The eye reads the entire area as uniformly overwhelmed, which is precisely the effect the composition is designed to achieve.⸻7.Forensic AnalysisThis drone image of Al Saraya Square continues the pattern already established in the preceding sections — the deliberate selection of emotionally loaded civic locations such as religious communal gatherings, schools, a stadium, a cultural center, and symbolically charged public squares. Each chosen landmark carries symbolic weight, allowing the imagery to suggest that the core pillars of civil life have been uniformly devastated. The visual strategy remains consistent. Recognizable public spaces are used to amplify emotional resonance and to imply total societal collapse.Al Saraya Square is framed as a mass displacement zone despite only limited visible shelter presence, while the wider scene shows active roads and largely intact surrounding buildings.The frame places a single major ruin in the lower right quadrant and uses it as the dominant emotional anchor. This is set against a wide backdrop of largely intact, multistory residential and commercial buildings with visible balconies, windows, and continuous urban density. The altitude is calibrated to exaggerate the scale of devastation while still keeping the selected ruin as the visual centerpiece.The caption claims that Al Saraya Square has become a shelter area for hundreds of families, yet the visible evidence shows a limited number of tents and temporary structures scattered across the ground. Roadways around the square remain active, with vehicles and pedestrians moving freely. This contradicts the implication of a space overwhelmed by displaced populations.This follows the broader pattern seen in the series. Symbolic civic spaces are selected, a single cluster of damage or tents is isolated and then framed as representative of the whole, regardless of what the surrounding built environment actually shows.⸻8.Forensic AnalysisThis aerial photograph of the Old Gaza Cemetery uses asymmetry as its primary emotional engine. The photographer positions the camera at a high diagonal so the frame tilts visually to broken tombs in the foreground. This steep compositional gradient creates a psychological fall from the living city into a landscape of destruction and prompts the viewer to feel that devastation is expanding outward from the cemetery toward civilian life.An aerial view of the Old Gaza Cemetery. The framing creates a stark asymmetry between the surrounding intact high-rise buildings and the cemetery below, and heightens emotional impact while aligning with the wider pattern of selecting symbolic civic landmarks to shape perception.The cemetery itself is selected for its maximum symbolic charge. As a resting place of ancestors, heritage, and communal identity, damage here carries heavier emotional weight than rubble from ordinary streets. This mirrors the pattern across all eight images — a deliberate focus on emotionally loaded civic landmarks, including schools, stadiums, cultural centers, religious gatherings, tourist zones, and now burial grounds. None of the chosen sites is neutral. They are chosen for their capacity to amplify emotional interpretation rather than provide balanced spatial context.Crucially, the image, like the others, omits any reference to the subterranean tunnel network beneath Gaza, which is directly relevant to ground instability, collapse patterns, and the scale of surface damage. This omission is consistent across Anadolu’s drone and aerial sets and forms part of the visual narrative strategy documented throughout this article.⸻ConclusionAcross all of these drone images, the pattern is the same. The footage is constructed, not simply found.Viewers are shown rubble and not recovery. Gray light and not the bright sun that also exists. Selective ruin and not the functioning streets that lie just beyond the frame. A short flight becomes a sweeping visual judgment about an entire territory.These frames are not neutral aerial documents. They are narrative objects, controlled visual statements that are designed to evoke sympathy, assign blame and reinforce existing political messages.What is left out is often more important than what is included.The functioning neighborhoods nearby.Market activity just beyond the crop.Operational context, such as tunnel shafts or controlled demolitions.The real weather and light that are narrowed down into a single gray moment.Drone footage has become one of the most persuasive tools in the global information war. To restore visual integrity and challenge false or distorted narratives, audiences and editors alike must learn to read these images for what they are. They show one chosen slice of reality, not the whole.The truth is not at altitude.The truth lives in the context that was deliberately left outside the frame.[/sc]",

      "content": "Key takeaways:Major media outlets, including NBC, have repeatedly minimized or obscured Hamas’s documented sexual atrocities from October 7, despite overwhelming physical evidence and survivor testimony.NBC’s latest segment manufactured false equivalence by pairing verified hostage accounts with unsubstantiated accusations against Israel promoted by anti-Israel NGOs, presenting both as morally comparable.By framing Hamas’s rape campaign as just “one side” of the story, NBC distorted the facts, diluted the gravity of the crimes, and ultimately undermined justice for Israeli victims of sexual violence.The media campaign to downplay—or outright deny—thesexual violence perpetrated by Hamasand other Palestinian terrorists did not begin with NBC. In the aftermath of the October 7 massacre, as testimonies emerged of gang rapes, sexual mutilation, and other atrocities against Israeli civilians, both activist NGOs and major news outlets appeared reluctant to confront the reality. Rather than treating the evidence with the gravity it demanded, some chose minimization, equivocation, or silence.Why?For certain advocacy groups that operate under a highly selective definition of “human rights,” acknowledging such crimes would have posed an inconvenient problem: Western public sympathy might have shifted decisively away from Hamas. On the college campuses where #MeToo became a core banner of social-justice activism, how would it have looked for activists to reconcile the celebration of “resistance” with the documented rape of women and girls? The answer is simple: it would have shattered the preferred narrative that portrays October 7 as a form of liberation rather than what it was – an orgy of terror and sadism.For sections of the media, the dilemma was similar. For years, audiences have been fed a reductive story: Gaza is portrayed as an open-air prison whose residents merely seek freedom. But does a movement genuinely pursuing political self-determination engage in mass sexual violence? Do men motivated by liberation rape teenagers? The facts ofOctober 7directly contradict the mythology.And those facts are now overwhelming. Beyond physical evidence gathered at massacre sites, returning Israeli hostages—young men included—have recounted, on the record, their own experiences of sexual abuse at the hands of Hamas captors. These are named victims, presenting personal testimonies with extraordinary courage.Yet rather than covering these accounts with the seriousness they deserve,NBC Newschose once again to muddy the waters.Propaganda by ‘Balance’In a video segment titled “Former hostages, prisoners allege sexual abuse from both Hamas and Israeli forces,” correspondent Hala Gorani devoted just over a minute to the Israeli survivors before pivoting to the narrative that clearly constituted the intended focus of the piece: “disturbing” allegations that Israel had itself used sexual violence as a “weapon of war.”The framing is stark. Verified hostage testimony is treated as merely one side of a supposedly symmetrical story, with the second side supplied not by named Palestinian victims, but by claims from the NGOB’Tselem, an activist group with an anti-Israel agenda. Gorani presented these allegations as equivalent to Israeli eyewitness accounts, despite offering no direct Palestinian victims, no independent corroboration, and no verifiable evidence beyond third-party claims.This is not an accident. NBC could not produce Palestinian survivors because none have come forward to substantiate the charges being promoted. There is testimony where it exists – Israeli testimony. But there is none supporting the mass-rape allegations levelled at Israel.Gorani declares, “sexual violence has nothing to do with sex. It is about wielding a weapon of war… You find it in every conflict zone.”The implication is clear: that Israeli forces must therefore also be committing rape as part of warfare – systematically, as NBC invites viewers to believe. But implication is not evidence. And evidence was precisely what NBC did not provide.The Leaked Video NarrativeNBC further invoked a leaked video from an Israeli detention facility, claiming it showed the “gang rape” of a Palestinian detainee. Gorani went on to assert: “A scandal erupted in Israel – not so much about the rape itself, but about the leak.”This is false.The scandal stemmed from the deceptive presentation of stitched-together footage supplied to the media, which created a narrative unsupported by the full unedited material. Israeli authorities investigated the circumstances surrounding both the incident and the edited leak – actions entirely inconsistent with NBC’s insinuation that Israel cared more about embarrassment than the crime itself.NBC then compounded its distortion through language choice: Israeli hostage abuse was described as “alleged,” despite being supported by sworn victim testimony. Yet the grainy CCTV video, unverifiable and selectively edited, was reported as fact – no qualifier attached.Moral Equivalence by ConstructionThis segment requires little dissection beyond identifying its core sleight of hand: NBC constructed moral equivalence between documented mass rape by terrorists and unsubstantiated accusations made by anti-Israel NGOs.Even if NBC wished to cover claims against Israeli detention facilities, the editorial decision to stitch those claims into a segment featuring hostage testimonies was a conscious act of narrative laundering. Rather than reporting facts as facts and allegations as allegations—each with appropriate scrutiny—NBC chose to merge them, flattening the distinction between evidence and advocacy.Why embed unproven claims alongside Israeli victims describing their abuse unless the goal is to dull the impact of their testimony?The effect is calculated: viewers leave not knowing what happened, but believing that “everyone did it” – that atrocities on October 7 were simply part of a morally indistinct conflict where truth is unknowable and justice arbitrary.What NBC Actually AchievedNBC did not illuminate crimes against humanity – it obscured them.It transformed rape testimony into a pretext for political balancing. It elevated activist claims to parity with firsthand survivor evidence. And it perpetuated a grotesque fiction: that Hamas sexual violence is merely one datapoint in a symmetrical story rather than the deliberate war crime it indisputably represents.Israeli victims spoke. NBC drowned them out.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:Middle East Eye markets itself as an independent news source, but ownership records show it is controlled entirely by a former Al Jazeera executive with ties to Al-Quds TV, a channel widely identified as Hamas-affiliated.Despite its opaque funding and leadership background, MEE reaches millions on social media, making it one of the most influential – yet least scrutinized – drivers of anti-Israel narratives for Gen Z audiences.MEE’s editorial pattern consistently aligns with Qatari- and Hamas-friendly messaging, including platforming Hamas leaders and pushing “genocide” accusations, raising urgent questions about whose interests the outlet truly serves.Middle East Eyeisn’t just growing. It’s skyrocketing.The London-based outlet describes itself as “an independently funded digital news organisation covering stories from the Middle East and North Africa, as well as related content from beyond the region.”It claims that “Its unique coverage offers on-the-ground news, comment and analysis that brings local viewpoints to the fore. Reporters are encouraged to read between the lines and take stories one step further rather than simply follow the official narrative.”OnTikTok,Instagram,YouTube, andFacebook, MEE’s videos now reach millions of young viewers, turning it into one of the most influential narrators of Middle East coverage. Its explainers and emotional reels circulate widely with no disclosure of who funds the outlet, who controls it, or any connections it may have through past leadership roles to extremists or associated groups.Middle East Eye’s significance today isn’t just about its content. It’s about its sheer reach. OnTikTokalone, the outlet’s videos regularly draw hundreds of thousands to millions of views. This makes MEE one of the most influential, yet least scrutinized, narrators of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict on social media. Its ascent mirrors the rise of AJ+, which similarly built enormous online influence while operating largely under the radar of traditional media oversight. Understanding MEE’s impact means recognizing that it isn’t a fringe publication. It is shaping the worldview of a generation.Because Middle East Eye positions itself as an “independent” authority on Israel and Gaza for a global Gen Z audience, the public deserves to understand the origins, ownership, and ideological infrastructure behind the brand.And the documents tell a very different story from the outlet’s marketing.Companies House filings in the UK show thatMiddle East Eye Limitedis controlled by one person:Jamal Awn Jamal Bessasso, a Dutch national of Palestinian origin. He owns more than 75% of the shares, more than 75% of voting rights, and has the power to appoint or remove directors. According to mediareports, before creating Middle East Eye, Bessasso served as:Director of planning and human resources at Al Jazeera in Qatar.Director of Samalink TV, a company that broadcast Al-Quds TV, repeatedly identified inresearchand media investigations as a Hamas-affiliated or Hamas-controlled station.Despite this, MEE’s editor-in-chief, former Guardian journalistDavid Hearst, hasinsistedthe outlet does not receive funds from any government. He has never disclosed donors or funders, nor addressed why Bessasso–and only Bessasso–appears in official ownership documents.And for years, Gulf states have accused MEE of functioning as a Qatari-backed media arm, specifically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. During the 2017 Gulf crisis, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egyptdemandedthat Qatar shut down MEE entirely, along with Al Jazeera.Then there is the editorial pattern — which consistently elevates Hamas voices.Hearst, who onceexpressedhis fervent wish for “the end of Zionism,” in 2018, penned anop-ed in MEE, in which he raged against what he perceived as “Jewish supremacy” in Israel and ludicrously claimed the country was not a democracy.In 2020, Hearst personally conducted a full-length interview in Istanbul with Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh that MEEpublished.Throughout the most recent Israel-Hamas war, Middle East Eye was among the most prominent outlets amplifying claims of Israeli “genocide,” publishing sympathetic long-form interviews with Hamas leaders and pushing narratives that closely align with Hamas messaging.This aligns with what someanalystshave claimed: Middle East Eye is viewed as operating within a Qatari-aligned media ecosystem that often overlaps with narratives favored by Hamas.Why This Matters NowMiddle East Eye’s audience is no longer niche or regional. It is shaping the worldview of millions of young Western readers and viewers, many of whom have no idea that the outlet’s founder previously held senior roles in a company that broadcast Al-Quds TV, a channel widely described as Hamas-affiliated, or that Arab states see it as a mouthpiece for Qatar.In an era when social networks label “state-affiliated media,” MEE has slipped under the radar — presenting itself as a grassroots, progressive, independent voice while operating inside an ecosystem that seems to have problematic ties to Hamas.This does not mean every article MEE publishes is false. It does mean that transparency is essential, especially when an outlet becomes one of the most influential narrators in Middle East coverage.If Middle East Eye wants the public to trust it, it should disclose its backers. Until then, journalists, policymakers, and readers must ask a simple question:Whose story is MEE really telling, and whose war is it helping to fight?Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:Media coverage of Pope Leo XIV’s Lebanon visit whitewashed Hezbollah, ignoring its long history of targeting Lebanon’s Christian community.Outlets repeatedly blamed Israel for instability, omitting Hezbollah’s ceasefire violations, attacks on Israeli civilians, and its systematic rebuilding of military infrastructure in southern Lebanon.By echoing Hezbollah’s narratives instead of scrutinizing them, major news organizations misled audiences and distorted the reality of which actor – Israel or Hezbollah – is driving Lebanon’s ongoing crises.Pope Leo XIV’s first visit to the Middle East was met with excitement and applause. When he touched down in Lebanon, supporters from all walks of life lined the streets to cheer him on – including, surprisingly,Hezbollah and its supporters.In fact, Hezbollah’sImam Al-Mahdi Scouts Association, a pro-terror youth movement that primes children and teenagers to become engaged with Hezbollah from a young age, was also present. These are the same scouts that filled a stadium in commemoration of Hassan Nasrallah.Some 60,000 children and teens, members of Hezbollah’s scouts, are participating in a gathering in Beirut to commemorate Hassan Nasrallah, under the name “Generations of the Sayyed.”pic.twitter.com/sIDIYgoPey— Ariel Oseran أريئل أوسيران (@ariel_oseran)October 12, 2025That did not stop the Irish Times from glancing over Hezbollah’s grooming of children, reducing the scouts’ role in its coverage to the benign description that the scouts were “assembling to perform,” portraying them as an innocent, ordinary youth movement, rather than an organization indoctrinating children into a terrorist movement.Hezbollah itself released a warmstatementdiscussing Lebanon’s “diverse composition,” and the hardships the Lebanese were facing “as a result of the Zionist occupation of parts of their land, and the continuation of its attacks against them and the threat to their security and stability in their country.”What was striking was how unsurprised many in the media seemed by Hezbollah’s enthusiastic embrace of the Pope. This, despite the fact thatLebanon’s Christian populationhas steadily declined since Hezbollah’s rise to power. A country that once had a Christian majority has since become majority Muslim, in large part due to Hezbollah’s growing influence and the resulting sense of insecurity that has pushed many Christians to leave. The Christian community in Lebanon has specificallybeen the target of Hezbollahand Hezbollah-affiliated attacks throughout the years.When the media did manage to acknowledge the declining Christian population and the broader deterioration of the country, it was frequently mentioned in the context of the war between Hezbollah and Israel, with the blame falling on Israel alone.TakeNBC’s coverageof the Pope’s visit, which referred to Israel’s “near daily attacks in Lebanon,” while noting that Lebanon is home to one of the largest Christian populations in the Middle East. Yet the report offered no context as to why Israel has been carrying out targeted strikes in Lebanon (hint: Hezbollah’s refusal to abide by the ceasefire and disarm).In omitting that context, the coverage distorted the reality, implying that Israel is targeting Lebanon in ways that endanger the ancient Christian community. However, Israel has consistently protected minority groups bothwithin Israeland more broadlyin the region– a stark contrast to Hezbollah, whose actions have destabilized Lebanon and driven minorities out.WhileThe Washington Postdid acknowledge that Lebanese Christians were leaving the country after Hezbollah gained more control, the journalists couldn’t help but insert blame on Israel for the decline in the Christian population in Bethlehem.Yes, the drain of Christians from Bethlehem has been underway for years – a result of discrimination, harassment, and violence from their Muslim neighbors under Palestinian Authority rule.But@washingtonpostwon’t look beyond simply blaming Israel.pic.twitter.com/xBxvoFU1BN— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)December 1, 2025Israel might be the convenient target, but it is not the primary reason for the decline of Bethlehem’s Christian population.Recommended Reading:History Repeating Itself as Bethlehem’s Christians Face ExtinctionHezbollah remains a threat not only to Israel but also to the Christians who reside in Lebanon, especially as it refuses to adhere to the ceasefire. The terror group continues to work to rebuild its infrastructure in southern Lebanon, threatening the stability of the region.Yet none of this has stopped the media from framing Israel as the aggressor, even in coverage of the Pope’s visit. For some outlets, it seems no story is complete without one more jab at Israel’s acts of self-defense.CNN, for instance, appears to believe that Hezbollah only needed to stop firing rockets at Israeli civilians for the ceasefire to hold, without mentioning that Hezbollah also needs to disarm. When Israel fires, it does not do so indiscriminately, but through targeted operations aimed at Hezbollah leaders and infrastructure actively working to rebuild the group’s military capabilities.Except Hezbollah hasn’t ceased, and that’s why Israel is firing.Not firing rockets into Israel is only a small part of Hezbollah’s ceasefire obligations. Rebuilding its forces in southern Lebanon is a violation.@CNN‘s@bencnnwon’t give you the full picture.pic.twitter.com/71hEHsJcQf— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)November 30, 2025It is alarming that coverage of the Pope’s visit to Lebanon frequently echoed some of the same anti-Israel talking points found in Hezbollah’s press release of the event. It should sound as a wake-up call to the media to report accurately and objectively, scrutinizing the narratives of terrorist organizations rather than blindly amplifying their talking points.Unfortunately, for many outlets, defaulting back to the “blame Israel” narrative appears easier than naming the terrorist organization responsible for Lebanon’s crises.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:University antisemitism persists despite the Gaza ceasefire, with faculty and student leaders promoting false genocide claims, Holocaust inversion, and openly hostile rhetoric toward Jewish students and Zionists.Academic credibility is collapsing, as courses and lectures at top universities rely on debunked allegations about Israel and platform speakers who spread classic antisemitic tropes, blood libels, and October 7 denial.Student leaders and campus activists are normalizing Jew-hatred, using anti-Israel politics to justify social exclusion, demonization, and weaponization of Jewish trauma, leaving Jewish students unsafe and higher-education standards in crisis.There may be a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, but on university campuses globally, antisemitism has yet to end. The encampments that took up space both on the lawns of universities and on the front pages of newspapers may be gone, but the new form of antisemitism, one that student leaders and professors are driving, is not.Antisemitic AcademiaThe top global universities are expected to train students to become the next leaders in society. That requires complex courses to be taught with accuracy and objectivity.This is not the case at Princeton, however. One course, entitledGender, Reproduction, and Genocide, is scheduled for the spring 2025-2026 semester. Taught by Nadera Shalhoub-Kevorkian, the course is said to explore “genocide through the analytic of gender” and specifically will focus on the “ongoing genocide in Gaza.”In the course, students will “engage reproductive justice frameworks,” suggesting that Israel is committing genocide by deliberately targeting institutions that would prevent women from becoming pregnant. However, this claim, spread by the UN, has no factual basis.UN’s fake “genocide report” accuses Israel of intentionally striking Gaza Al-Basma IVF clinic to destroy embryos to “prevent births” and “destroy future of Palestinians.” This claimed attack is a key aspect of the claim. But there is ZERO evidence for any of it. Analysis: 1/pic.twitter.com/t6n855r5an— Aizenberg (@Aizenberg55)September 17, 2025The UN report relies on a 2024 ABC News story thatclaimedan IDF shell was deliberately fired at an IVF clinic in December 2023, allegedly destroying more than 4,000 embryos with the intention to “prevent births.” But even ABC News and its sole source, who was not present at the time, could not verify that an IDF shell caused the damage. In fact, a wide-angle photo of the scene shows a nearby high-rise building visibly damaged, while the IVF clinic itself appears fully intact.If the course’s entire framework being held up by falsified information wasn’t enough, it also seeks to compare the history of the “genocide” in Gaza to other genocides, including the Holocaust. There is no lack of moral clarity more evident than flattening the Holocaust into a political talking point. No comparison can be made between a war of defense and the industrialization of murder that the Nazis waged against the Jewish people.Yet, this vile comparison does not come as much of a surprise, considering the professor herself has, in the past,denied the murder and assault of Jews. For a course that bases itself on feminism and reproductive frameworks to be taught by a professor who has accused Israel of lying about the rapes and murder of babies on October 7 is not only profoundly immoral, but also an outright betrayal of the feminist standards she supposedly upholds.Antisemitism from faculty is not limited to academic courses. A Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) chapter at University College London hosted Samar Maqusi as part of a series titled “Palestine: From Existence to Resistance.” Although the lecture was advertised as a discussion on the origins of Zionism, Maqusi instead promoted classic antisemitic tropes, including that Jews require the blood of gentiles for making their “special pancakes,” referring to a medieval blood libel in which Jews use the blood of gentiles for making matzah.Antisemitism at UCL Event With University Research FellowA StandWithUs UK student shared this recording with us, exposing awful comments made by a UCL academic during a lecture at University College London.During a lecture titled “The Birth of Zionism”, delivered by Dr…pic.twitter.com/0RF9Ooz3d6— StandWithUsUK (@StandWithUsUK)November 13, 2025Unfortunately, many discussions of Zionism on university campuses come from those with hostile and thus inaccurate beliefs on what it truly means to be a Zionist. Even in aninterfaith discussionat the City College of New York, a Hillel director was told he was “responsible for the murder” of Gazans and caused “disgust” in other participants because he was a Zionist. Activist and student groups further condemned the interfaith discussion. Not in favor of defending the Hillel director whose sole wrongdoing was being a Jew, but because interfaith efforts were causing the “normalization of Zionism.”In warping the definitions to fit the narrative of the speaker or lecturer, lectures and campus spaces have become breeding grounds for bias and thinly veiled antisemitism.Antisemitic Student VoicesStudent leaders and activists have also frequently isolated their Jewish peers.At The Harvard Crimson, one column suggests that there are some “visions of Zionism more morally objectionable” and therefore one might “feel wary of staying friends with Zionists.” It should then be no wonder to the author why Jewish studentsfeel isolated on campuses.This becomes all the more problematic when the students elected to represent the entire student union are not neutral nor representative on complex issues, particularly regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at large.At the University of Oxford, the Oxford Student Union elected Arwa Elrayess as the incoming president. She has been part of a no-budget documentary on the pro-Palestine protests that erupted after October 7. In one post promoting the film, Elrayess makes the moral equivalence between the Holocaust and the war against Hamas in Gaza by comparing the deaths of Anne Frank and Hind Rajab, a Gazan civilian.Elrayess is meant to represent all students equally. Still, her posts suggest otherwise and are part of a worrying trend of using Jewish trauma to uncritically discuss Israel’s war.As the current academic year continues, it remains clear that the issue of antisemitism on campus has not gone away, nor can it be afforded to be swept aside and ignored. When courses are built on debunked claims and student leaders use Holocaust inversion to further their anti-Israel narratives, it becomes evident that this issue is not isolated but rather is systemic, requiring urgent and sustained action.Jewish students on campuses worldwide deserve the same safety and respect as any other student, and all students deserve an education grounded in truth and accuracy. The moral and intellectual integrity of higher education depends on confronting antisemitism directly, rather than allowing it to fester under the guise of activism or academic freedom.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:Terror threats from the West Bank are severe and ongoing, with thousands of attacks and attempted attacks each year despite minimal media attention.Israel’s counterterrorism efforts – such as Operation Five Stones, recently launched in the northern West Bank – are essential and effective, dramatically reducing successful attacks by targeting hotspots like Jenin, Tulkarm, and Tubas.Major outlets routinely distort or omit key facts, downplaying that eliminated individuals were terrorists and echoing propaganda from Hamas and Islamic Jihad, thereby misinforming global audiences about the scale of the threat Israel faces.Compared to the terror threats emanating from numerous fronts, including Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, and Iran, the international media often downplays or dismisses the dangers Israel faces from the West Bank.After the October 7 massacre, Hamas made no effort to hide its intentions toopen a front in the West Bank, calling on Palestinians to take up arms against Israel.In 2024, Israel faced over18,000 incidentsof terrorism, according to the National Public Diplomacy Directorate. TheShin Bet, Israel’s internal security agency, thwarted 1,040 incidents in the West Bank and Jerusalem in 2024, with an additional 231 significant terror incidents reported.In 2025, the threat persisted. InFebruary 2025, a terrorist from the Nablus area of the West Bank triggered a series of explosions on buses in the Tel Aviv area. Fortunately, the explosives detonated when the buses were empty, causing no injuries.In September, a deadly terror attack at theRamot Junctionin Jerusalem killed six innocent people and injured twenty-one others. The terrorists came from the West Bank.This week, onNovember 29, a terrorist hurled an iron rod at the windshield of a car on Route 5, a highway in the northern West Bank. Miraculously, no one was physically injured, but the incident underscores the threat targeting Israelis.An iron rod was thrown at an Israeli vehicle on Highway 5 near Mas’ha in the northern West Bank, piercing the windshield in front of the driver. Authorities say the attack appears terrorist in nature.https://t.co/cZTUfqPahA— The Jerusalem Post (@Jerusalem_Post)November 29, 2025The security challenge is real and ongoing. It targets Israelis, no matter where in the country they are.After the ceasefire went into effect in the Gaza Strip in October, analysts found that Hamas and other terrorist organizations began reorganizing theiroperations in the West Bankas a way to continue their so-called “resistance.”For these reasons, on November 26, the IDF launchedOperation Five Stones, a counterterrorism operation specifically aimed at countering threats in the northern West Bank.Naturally, terrorist groups condemned the operation. That didn’t stop AFP from reiterating the press releases from Hamas and Islamic Jihad.Terrorists condemn Israeli anti-terror operation.Cutting-edge reporting from@AFP&@France24_en.pic.twitter.com/eDLNA4IU2R— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)November 27, 2025Counter-terrorism efforts by the IDF have proven successful. In the first nine months of 2025,22 terrorism incidentswere carried out by Palestinian terrorists from the West Bank, in comparison to 90 in 2024. With the launch of the new operation, the IDF is strategically operating in specific locations in the West Bank that have become hotspots tied to previous terror attacks, including Jenin, Tulkarm, Nur Shams, Tubas, and Tammun. These cities and villages have become operational hubs for Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and other Iranian-backed groups, producing everything from roadside bombs to shooting cells to coordinated plots targeting Israeli civilians across the country.Me’ata, a Palestinian media center, claimed that in October 2025, there were 356 “popular resistance actions” in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem, including 16 incidents of planting and detonating explosive devices, mainly in the Jenin and Tubas areas. One of thoseexplosions in Tubasleft two IDF soldiers injured.Jenin is perhaps the media’s favorite West Bank location to cover, consistently referring to it as the “martyrs’ capital.” What most outlets leave out, however, is that the name reflects the city’s role as the origin for more than one-third of terrorist attacks during the Second Intifada. The next time you read “martyrs’ capital,” know that the journalist is really referring to terrorism.The Jenin refugee camp is the terror capital of the West Bank – the source of multiple acts of terrorist violence against Israeli civilians going back many years.But to@latimes? It’s a “symbol of Palestinian resistance.”pic.twitter.com/ZIRw5dZIeD— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)November 26, 2025The IDF began intensively operating in Jenin in January 2025, following aterrorist attackcarried out by terrorists from the Jenin area that left three Israelis dead.Recommended Reading:Jenin: The Palestinian Terror Capital & Its Threat to the RegionDuring the current operation in Jenin, the IDF eliminated two terrorists claimed by Islamic Jihad.

This omission leaves readers with a distorted impression of the event and obscures the context of ongoing terrorist activity in Jenin.Sky News went so far as to suggest the two were not terrorists at all.There’s nothing “invariably” about it. They were claimed by Islamic Jihad – a terrorist org – as two of their own.Invariably biased courtesy of@adamparsonsat@SkyNews.pic.twitter.com/T1ZJUL0TUa— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)November 30, 2025The terrorist threat Israel faces from the West Bank is not theoretical or isolated, nor did it disappear after the October 7 terrorist attacks. Had the IDF not continuously acted to prevent further attacks, Israelis would be facing a far deadlier and more coordinated terrorism campaign today.After October 7, Israel vowed never again to let the country or the Jewish people face such devastation and insecurity. A secure Israel after that massacre means dismantling terror networks before they can carry out mass-casualty attacks, not after. It means denying Hamas and Islamic Jihad the ability to embed in civilian areas, buildexplosives factories, or dispatch terrorists into Israeli cities. In a post-October 7 reality, counterterrorism is not optional. It is the prerequisite for any genuine stability, security, or peace.Liked this article?

Headlines warned of “mass starvation,” photos of emaciated children (mostly with pre-existing conditions) filled front pages, and Israel was vilified as deliberately starving civilians.But when new data emerged that undermined the entire famine narrative, those same outlets suddenly lost their appetite for reporting.The updated numbers, released in July-August bythe Global Nutrition Cluster(GNC), a group of UN and other aid agencies, paint a starkly different picture. The GNC found malnutrition rates roughly 23% lower than those used by the IPC. The highest rate measured was 11.9%, which isbelowthe 15% malnutrition threshold that defines famine. This is not a minor revision. It is a total collapse of the most alarming claim made about Gaza’s humanitarian situation.And yet, the media that treated the original IPC report as gospel did not cover this correction. Not one major Western outlet ran a headline acknowledging that the famine claim had been based on flawed data. The story simply evaporated. No accountability. No follow-up. No explanation.The Nutrition Cluster finally published the materials from their Sep 17 meeting, confirming that the IPC “analysis” was indeed based on fabricated data that misrepresented the raw, unweighted malnutrition statistics as if they were the properly age-weighted data required by IPC…https://t.co/WOk7RYOK3Fpic.twitter.com/QQqfNNo41W— Mark Zlochin – מארק זלוצ’ין༝ (@MarkZlochin)October 15, 2025This silence matters. The IPC’s famine declaration did not unfold in a vacuum. Its figures were used to hammer Israel diplomatically, spark UN condemnations, inflameprotests, and put Jewish communities at risk worldwide. Once “Israel is starving Gaza”became a viral talking point, it didn’t matter that Israeli officials and independent analysts questioned the report’s accuracy. It didn’t matter that key data was missing. It didn’t matter that the numbers were inconsistent or that the methodology was weak. What mattered was that the accusation fit the narrative, so it was believed.Related Reading:The Gaza Famine Report: Questionable Methods & Anti-Israel AuthorsNow we know more about those flaws.Criticspointed out that the IPC relied on incomplete datasets, pulled numbers from clinic-only screenings that do not represent the general population, and shifted to MUAC-only measurements — a quick arm-circumference test that is known to overestimate malnutrition. These issues were substantial enough to cast doubt on the entire famine declaration.But instead of revisiting their own coverage, the same outlets that amplified the original claims chose to ignore the updated data. The famine panic was newsworthy; the correction, apparently, was not.This is not just a journalistic failure. It’s a dangerous one. Once a humanitarian accusation of this scale is made, it becomes a weapon. It shapes protests, justifies threats, and fuels antisemitism. If the story collapses, but the media refuses to report it, the lie continues to live.And this is exactly what happened. Even as the GNC data undercut the famine claim, the global discourse remained stuck in August: Israel was still being accused of starving Gaza. The emotional imagery that accompanied the IPC report continues to circulate online. The outrage it generated still shapes public perception. The correction never got the same megaphone.UN’s Gaza Famine Fraud Exposed:IPC tested 15,700 kids for malnutrition in July and found 12%—below 15% famine thresholdProblematic. So what did they do?Use a smaller incomplete 7,100 sample showing 16%Solved. Now UN can claim famine in Gaza!Evidence & sources:pic.twitter.com/Re1grOvGsQ— Aizenberg (@Aizenberg55)August 24, 2025This should be a wake-up call. In conflict zones, information is a battlefield, and humanitarian terminology, like “famine,” “siege,” or “starvation,” can be misused for political ends. When journalists fail to interrogate their sources or revisit their own reporting, misinformation hardens into “truth.”Readers should take note: if journalists won’t be skeptical, you must be. Every dramatic humanitarian claim warrants scrutiny. Every alarming statistic should be questioned. Every institution, even UN-affiliated bodies, must be held accountable for accuracy. Because if not, falsehoods travel, outrage spreads, and real people pay the price.In this case, Israel’s reputation was smeared, global discourse was distorted, and Jewish communities were exposed to heightened risk, all based on data that didn’t hold up. And the media, which should have corrected the record, simply looked the other way.So next time a headline declares catastrophe, treat it with the skepticism journalists should have shown in the first place.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:LA Times bureau chief Nabih Bulos routinely distorts history and assigns blame to Israel, pushing narratives that excuse Hamas, erase terrorism, and misrepresent key facts such as the origins of Hamas and the causes of regional instability.Bulos’s reporting repeatedly sanitizes or glorifies terrorist organizations, from whitewashing Hamas operatives to framing the Jenin terror hub as “resistance,” while minimizing or ignoring decades of attacks on Israeli civilians.His coverage of Hezbollah further demonstrates a clear anti-Israel bias, reframing precision counterterrorism operations as assaults on civilians and downplaying Hezbollah’s aggression, all while violating the journalistic standards the LA Times claims to uphold.The Los Angeles Times seeks to hold itself above reproach. Unfortunately, its Middle East bureau chief, Nabih Bulos, has consistently published biased and inaccurate articles – as well as his own social media posts – that betray the very standards he is meant to uphold.With over 63,000 followers on X and writing for the largest daily metropolitan newspaper, Bulos’s impact is unmistakable. But his anti-Israel bias speaks volumes about the narrative he is spreading and brings into question his capacity to report accurately on such a tense region.Distorting History, Blaming IsraelBulos repeatedly demonstrates an inability to recognize the complex and dangerous neighborhood in which he is reporting from. In one post on X, responding to a statement that “Israel is in a tough neighborhood,” Bulos questions, “Why did it become a tough neighborhood?”The insinuation is clear: Israel is to blame for the instability and hostility in the region. This kind of historical revisionism distorts decades of regional dynamics, conflicts, and threats from terrorist organizations and countries that previously or currently seek Israel’s destruction.Why did it become a tough neighborhood?https://t.co/4rJJCbzC6D— Nabih (@nabihbulos)August 17, 2024Similarly, in response to a statement by Piers Morgan that Hamas’ October 7th massacre cannot be compared to the Russia-Ukraine war, Bulossarcastically suggestedthat Israel bears responsibility for the terrorist attacks because of the conditions that preceded them. In reversing the responsibility and denying Hamas’ initiation of the war, Bulos implied that the massacre was essentially a natural response to prior Israeli actions. This rhetoric presents a narrative that portrays Israel as the root cause of regional violence – a position starkly at odds with the neutrality expected from a major newspaper’s Middle East bureau chief.This belief is not only found on his X feed but also in his published work. In one 2024 story covering the potential options for governance in post-war Gaza, Bulossuggestedthat because Israel “secretly helped create Hamas decades ago as a rival to the Palestinian Authority,” it would be concerned over any potential unity of Palestinians.Except, Israel did not create Hamas. It gave money to the charity organization Mujama al-Islamiya in 1979 as a way to curb the violence that Israeli civilians were facing from the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). When Mujama al-Islamiya began collecting arms, its leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, was thrown in jail in the mid-1980s. After the outbreak of the First Intifada, Yassin and four other Palestinians created Hamas, but Israel was not the party responsible for its creation.Did Israel create Hamas?pic.twitter.com/SS4nx1hA5d— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)November 17, 2023Yet again, this is not the first historical inaccuracy Bulos has published. He has also onceclaimedthat 750,000 Palestinians were expelled in 1948, distorting the fact that the vast majority were displaced, either in anticipation of or as a result of the war or in response to the Arab nations’ calls to leave the land while their armies invaded the newly formed Jewish state.Glamorizing Terrorist OrganizationsBulos’s reframing of history is not an isolated lapse but part of a broader pattern woven through his coverage. His reporting goes beyond mischaracterizing Israel and has time and again crossed into sanitizing or outright glamorizing the actions of terrorist organizations and terrorists.When Anas Al-Sharif was killed in an Israeli strike, Bulospostedthat Al-Sharif was “one of the hardest working journalists in Gaza” and amplified Al Jazeera while doing so. Not only does this raise serious questions about why he is uncritically boosting aQatari-funded outletknown for amplifying Hamas propaganda, but it also obscures the fact that Al-Sharif hadwell-documented ties to Hamasand regularly produced content aligned with the organization’s messaging.View this post on InstagramA post shared by HonestReporting (@honestreporting)Bulos’s amplification of terrorism goes beyond individual Hamas actors. In his latest piece for the LA Times, “West Bank camp, a symbol of Palestinian resistance, lies in ruins after Israeli campaign,” he explicitly glorifies the Jenin refugee camp as a place of “resistance against occupation.” In other words, he is describing terrorism.What Bulos omits is that the Jenin camp has long been amajor hub for terror activity. It is a base from which terrorists have attacked Israeli civilians and threatened communities.However, Bulos would be unable to recognize these key facts, as when he notes that the refugee camp gained its “reputation as the martyrs’ capital,” he deliberately excludes why. The name itself came from the fact that over one-third of all suicide bombings during the Second Intifada were carried out by terrorists from Jenin.The Jenin refugee camp is the terror capital of the West Bank – the source of multiple acts of terrorist violence against Israeli civilians going back many years.But to@latimes? It’s a “symbol of Palestinian resistance.”pic.twitter.com/ZIRw5dZIeD— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)November 26, 2025This is perhaps why he also feels comfortablequestioningthe dangerous neighborhood Israel finds itself in. Whether Bulos likes it or not, Israel faces a threat from terrorist organizations on every front –  all of which are either created, funded, armed, or directed by the Iranian regime, which is openly committed to eliminating the Jewish state. Given this reality, describing Israel’s neighborhood as dangerous isn’t a narrative choice but simply a fact.Downplaying HezbollahBulos’s inaccurate coverage of terrorist organizations is particularly biased when it comes to Hezbollah.After a Mossad agent went on 60 Minutes to discuss Israel’s successful pager operation against Hezbollah terrorists, Bulos reframed the operation as one that targeted innocent civilians. While a limited number of bystanders in the direct vicinity of the terrorists holding the pagers also sustained injuries, the overwhelming majority of thoseinjured were Hezbollah terrorists, as Israel intended. But Bulos’s portrayal distorts the nature of the operation and falsely recasts a precise counterterrorism operation as an assault on civilians.How can@60Minutesregurgitate an objectively incorrect statement like this? The pager explosions *did* harm & maim people near the ostensible targets, as my colleagues and I documented.https://t.co/oxeazluVFm— Nabih (@nabihbulos)December 25, 2024Naturally, Bulos remained silent on Hezbollah’s frequent attacks deliberately targeting Israeli civilians, including a rocket attack that resulted in the death of 12 Druze children inMajdal Shams. In fact, his only recognition of this attack wasregurgitatingHezbollah’s denial of the strike.It appears as a pattern of deliberate inability to acknowledge that Hezbollah attacks Israel and its civilians. Even when describing how Hezbollah inserted itself into the war on October 8, 2023, by attacking Israel and launching rockets, Bulos simplifies it as fighting Israel.Actually,@LATimes, Hezbollah did not “fight” Israel after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attacks.The terror org *attacked* Israel unprovoked on Oct. 8, escalating the conflict into a multi-front war.pic.twitter.com/kCA3H3AxwA— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)August 28, 2025This past week, in aninterview with CNN, Bulos held to the same narrative, claiming that Israel continues to fire on Lebanon, while the “Lebanese are ceasing,” and that Beirut is “accustomed to war.” Not once does he mention that Hezbollah has been actively working to rebuild its military infrastructure in southern Lebanon in direct violation of the ceasefire agreement. It is an unfortunate reality in which Hezbollah has hijacked Lebanon to feed its desire to destroy Israel. But Israel does not take action in foreign countries without reason; rather, the IDFtakes preemptive actions to undermine the threats it faces.Related Reading:What the Media Don’t Explain About Israel’s Fight With HezbollahBulos has clearly demonstrated an inability to cover the region with the neutrality that is required by his title. Whether it is on his personal social media or in his articles, he consistently reports in a manner that violates the LA Times’s standards. It has led HonestReporting to request corrections from his editorials on six separate occasions in 2025 alone.Bulos’ reporting does more than misinform. It gradually shifts public perception of conflicts in the region to be disproportionately hostile toward Israel. For a journalist with such a large platform and for a publication that claims to uphold the highest standards of accuracy and fairness, Bulos’s biased coverage underscores the urgent need for accountability and action.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:Senior BBC journalists repeatedly breach accuracy and impartiality on Israel, yet face minimal consequences—even when the BBC’s own oversight bodies confirm serious errors.Figures like Jeremy Bowen and Jon Donnison have shaped global anti-Israel narratives through inaccurate reporting, from misattributed images to premature accusations, while retaining influential roles at the publicly funded broadcaster.The BBC enforces accountability inconsistently—junior staff are penalized for antisemitism, but senior correspondents who distort Israel’s actions are protected, undermining the broadcaster’s credibility and claims of neutrality.As a publicly funded broadcaster, the BBC’s raison d’être is impartiality. On Israel and Gaza, however, its neutrality is constantly called into question. In part because some of its most high-profile journalists have built up a record of serious misjudgments, especially on social media, and yet remain in their posts. They remain while junior staff have been hung out to dry. Figures such as International Editor Jeremy Bowen and correspondent Jon Donnison seem to glide past meaningful censure, even when the BBC itself acknowledges that its standards were breached.For readers outside the UK, it is important to understand why these failures have caused such shock. The BBC is not simply another media outlet. It is a national institution created by royal charter, funded through a mandatory licence fee, and trusted for generations as the country’s primary source of news. It sits in British public life in a way that American networks simply do not. When the BBC gets a major international story wrong, it is not perceived as a single newsroom making a mistake. It is felt as a failure of a public service that is meant to belong to everyone.This is why the conduct of its senior correspondents matters so profoundly. When figures at the very top of the organization repeat errors, ignore caution or breach editorial guidelines, the damage extends far beyond a single report. It undermines the credibility of an institution that millions rely upon for neutral information.1/BBC in Crisis.Two top execs – Tim Davie & Deborah Turness – forced to quit after a bombshell dossier exposed bias and even doctored footage of Trump.You’d think that would spark real change, right?WRONG.pic.twitter.com/EK1AF8COXz— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)November 12, 2025Few cases illustrate this tension more clearly than the long record ofJeremy Bowen. His record is not a matter of perspective, but of formal findings made by the BBC’s own oversight bodies. In 2009, the BBC Trustupheld key complaintsagainst his reporting on Israel. In a BBC News article and a From Our Own Correspondent broadcast on the 1967 war, the Trust found that several statements were inaccurate and that the article had breached the BBC’s guideline on impartiality, criticizing Bowen’s wording as imprecise on questions of history and international law. His documentary The Birth of Israel provoked similar concerns from outside critics,including HonestReporting, who argued that it omitted crucial historical context. Although the BBC’s Editorial Standards Committee ultimately did not uphold the complaints, the controversy added to long-running questions about Bowen’s treatment of Israel.Yet Bowen did not lose his job. He remained for many years the BBC’s Middle East editor and is now the corporation’s International Editor, still shaping how millions understand the conflict. If a senior journalist produced content that BBC bodies declared inaccurate and biased on climate change, Brexit or the British economy, it is difficult to imagine management responding this way. On Israel, by contrast, the findings were treated as an inconvenient footnote. Lessons would supposedly be learned. Bowen carried on..@BowenBBCrepresents so much of what is wrong with@BBCNewscoverage of Israel. His reaction to@TrevorAsserson‘s damning report on the BBC’s treatment of the Israel-Hamas war comes as no surprise.https://t.co/3wS8W4IPOjpic.twitter.com/XtX07FmZcE— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)September 15, 2024Then there is journalistJon Donnison. His record reveals a pattern of carelessness that always seems to cut in the same direction. In 2012, while serving as the BBC’s Gaza and West Bank correspondent, hetweeted a photographof a bloodied child on a hospital bed, describing it as a heartbreaking image of a Palestinian victim of an Israeli strike. The child, in fact, was Syrian, and the image came from the Syrian civil war. Donnison apologised and deleted the tweet, but by then it had circulated widely.In 2012 he was forced to apologize after retweeting a photo of an injured Gazan child who was actually Syrian. But with the original retweet going out to more than 7,000 followers & receiving nearly 100 retweets of its own, the apology was too little too late to undo the damage.pic.twitter.com/VnBGY6knk6— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)October 20, 2023Fast forward to October 2023 and theexplosion at the Al-Ahli hospitalin Gaza. In the fog of breaking news, caution is not optional, particularly when the stakes include the global reputation of a democratic state and the mobilization of street protests across multiple continents. Reporting live as events unfolded, Donnison speculated on air that it washard to seehow the explosion could be anything other than an Israeli airstrike, heavily implying Israeli responsibility. As evidence accumulated, including independent open-source analysis, it became increasingly clear that the blast was likely caused by a misfired Palestinian rocket.Eventually, the BBC’s Executive Complaints Unitconcededthat the coverage had not met the corporation’s standards of due accuracy. Yet the issue was deemed resolved because a clarification had been posted online. The finding was not formally upheld. There was no disciplinary announcement. The journalist whose speculation helped shape a global narrative simply moved on to the next story.Even now, Donnison continues to test the limits of BBC impartiality. In February 2025, hetweetedthat propaganda efforts by Hamas and Israel over hostage releases were pretty nauseating, drawing an obscene equivalence between a democratic state lobbying for the release of kidnapped civilians and a terror organization that abducted them. Following public outrage, he deleted and apologized. Once again, there is no indication of meaningful sanction.The pattern is not limited to English language coverage. BBC Arabic has long been dogged by accusations of partisan behavior, including staff posting content on social media that openly endorses actors involved in the conflict. One senior journalist reportedly left only after refusing to cooperate with an internal investigation, raising troubling questions about how robust such processes really are.Here, the contrast with other cases becomes even more striking. When historic tweets by BBC Monitoring journalistTala Halawaresurfaced, including Hitler was right and Israel is more Nazi than Hitler, the BBCconfirmedthat she no longer worked for the corporation. In that instance, the red line was clear. Explicit genocidal antisemitism is incompatible with employment at the BBC. Rightly so.Tala Halawa is a “digital journalist” for the@BBC.Halawa directly influences and creates news content watched by many millions around the world.In what world can someone like this work for a professional news outlet?pic.twitter.com/r2LIHmZfF2— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)May 23, 2021But what message does it send when blatant breaches of accuracy and impartiality on Israel, repeated over many years by prominent correspondents, are dealt with through quiet clarifications and private apologies, while those same journalists retain their powerful platforms? Or when staff who openly cheer on armed resistance are allowed to continue reporting on Israeli civilians who are the targets of that resistance.The BBC now faces unprecedented scrutiny over its Israel-Gaza coverage. Leaked letters, internal memos and external reports all point to profound discomfort within the organization about how this conflict is being handled and about the ideological leanings of some of its staff. At the heart of the crisis lies a simple question: who is held accountable when BBC journalists get Israel wrong?Accountability cannot mean sacking the occasional junior figure for outrageous historic tweets while protecting senior correspondents whose on-air words reverberate globally in real time. It cannot mean allowing resolved complaints and quiet corrections to substitute for genuine consequences. If the BBC wants to be trusted on Israel, it must confront the record of figures like Jeremy Bowen and Jon Donnison honestly, rather than pretending that a few buried clarifications are enough. Until that happens, every new pledge of impartiality will ring hollow, especially to those who have been watching this pattern of failure for years.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:The photographer behind Gaza “flood” images, Abed Rahim Khatib, was documented inside Israel with Hamas on October 7, raising serious questions about the credibility and intent of his widely circulated photos.Each image selectively frames shallow puddles as “flooding,” using children, tight angles, and deliberate cropping to create an emotional narrative that contradicts the clearly dry surroundings.Across eight cases, captions and imagery systematically exaggerate hardship while omitting key facts—warm weather, dry ground, and Hamas-built tunnel infrastructure—revealing a coordinated effort to manufacture a global sympathy narrative rather than document reality.In mid-November, Israel and the Gaza Strip experienced the first rains of the season as the region was hit by a torrential downpour. This type of weather is not unusual for the time of year, and both Israeli and Palestinian cities suffer from flooding as drainage systems struggle to cope.Unsurprisingly, the flooding in Gaza became an international story weaponized to blame Israel.2/Gaza has suffered flooding numerous times before. In 2013, Hamas claimed that Israel had flooded parts of Gaza by opening its southern dams.The only problem? There are no dams in the south of Israel.https://t.co/1mWkV5QhyC— HonestReporting (@HonestReporting)November 17, 2025Let’s take a look at the photography behind this year’s Gaza flood through the lens of one photographer to demonstrate how images are manipulated to produce an emotional reaction that the reality doesn’t always mirror.Context: The Photographer Behind the LensUnderstanding the identity and history of the photographer is essential for interpreting the flood images.Abed Rahim Khatib whose work is distributed by Anadolu, AP, and Getty, is documented photographing inside Israel on the morning of October 7, 2023, at the breached border fence near destroyed IDF positions. These images confirm that he entered Israel alongside Hamas attackers in the first wave of the massacre and was present at active abduction and murder sites.This is not a small detail. It establishes that the same individual who photographed morgue scenes, hospital scenes, hostage transfer events, rubble, and now rainstorm puddles was physically part of the invasion footprint inside Israel.It is also relevant that Khatib works for Anadolu. Anadolu is a Turkish state-run news agency that operates with a consistent anti-Israel narrative and is a central distributor of Gaza-sourced imagery to international outlets. This institutional context matters.ScreenshotScreenshotScreenshotAbove: Images taken by Gaza-based photographer Abed Rahim Khatib inside Israel on the morning of October 7 at the breached border fence and destroyed IDF positions. His presence confirms direct access during the Hamas infiltration.⸻1.Forensic AnalysisA child cycles through an ankle-deep puddle. The caption claims heavy rain and cold weather, yet the sky is clear, and the conditions were approximately 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit). Two white cars in the background are parked entirely on dry ground. Multiple pedestrians stand or walk on dry concrete a few metres behind the child.The photographer shoots from a lowered angle, pointing slightly upward. This compresses the foreground water and heightens the emotional weight of the child. A higher or neutral vantage point would immediately reveal the dry horizon.From a technical standpoint, riding a bicycle through water is unusual. Water of this depth would damage pedals, chains and bearings. In a place with limited access to replacement parts, a child would realistically walk and carry the bicycle.ScreenshotAbove: A child rides through a shallow puddle while the surrounding area remains dry. The caption mentions cold weather but the conditions were warm and bright. The scene is selectively framed to exaggerate hardship.⸻2.Forensic AnalysisThe photograph positions five unhooded children in a car beside a donkey cart carrying three masked or hooded adult males. The adults conceal their faces. The children face the camera. This contrast creates an engineered emotional dynamic.The road surface behind both vehicles is dry. Pedestrians stand comfortably on unaffected ground. The supposed flood zone is only a shallow puddle in the immediate foreground.The photographer uses mid-height framing to compress the spatial depth. A tilt towards the foreground water and away from the dry areas strengthens the suggestion of wider inundation.ScreenshotAbove: Children are placed as the emotional center of the frame while the masked adults avoid visibility. The background shows dry ground, contradicting the idea of extensive flooding.⸻3.Forensic AnalysisA child runs through water in the foreground. Behind him, the horizon is dry. Cars and pedestrians stand entirely on dry ground. The caption again places blame exclusively on Israeli attacks while avoiding any mention of the warm weather or visible dryness.The photographer uses a slight forward lean and mid-depth focus to keep attention on the splashing foreground. The dry rear zone becomes background blur.ScreenshotAbove: A child runs through a puddle while cars and pedestrians remain on dry ground. The caption stresses hardship but the image shows only a localized patch of water.⸻4.Forensic AnalysisA small child stands in a thin reflective layer of water wearing flip-flops. No adults are visible. The child’s posture is neutral and unhurried, which contradicts the caption’s implication of worsening conditions. Tents in the mid-ground are on dry soil.The photographer uses a shallow depth of field to render the foreground puddle as more dominant than it is. The dry tent walls and dry ground are present but visually deemphasized.ScreenshotAbove: A child stands in a shallow reflective puddle while tents and paths behind remain dry. The caption implies worsening conditions but the environment shows minimal standing water.⸻5.Forensic AnalysisChildren jump and play in a shallow puddle. The water is thin and reflective. Behind them, both pathways and tent walls are dry. No adults appear in frame. The photographer crops tightly to exclude the wider dry area surrounding the scene.ScreenshotAbove: Despite dramatic headlines, this is a group of children playing in a puddle bordered by dry ground. No flooding is present.⸻6.Forensic AnalysisAn older man kneels on dry earth, repairing an object while a child stands beside him on entirely dry ground. A narrow puddle sits nearby but does not affect their movement. The photographer avoids showing the broad dry expanse surrounding them by choosing a compressed angle and tight frame.ScreenshotAbove: The caption refers to worsening rains, yet both subjects are on dry ground. This is an ordinary routine, not a flood impact.⸻7.Forensic AnalysisA line of children walks beside a shallow puddle. Multiple dry areas and parked vehicles sit behind them. The sunlight casts strong shadows, contradicting the claim of cold or severe weather. The photographer shoots from a mid-height to keep the puddle dominant, while the dryness behind is visible only at the edge of the frame.ScreenshotAbove: Children walk beside a shallow puddle while large dry areas and vehicles behind them show no flooding. The emotional message does not match environmental reality.⸻8.Forensic AnalysisA boy carries his shoes and steps into a shallow reflective puddle. Older boys follow behind him. The puddle is thin and localized. Tents, crates and fabric structures behind them are fully dry. The photographer tilts the frame to maintain the waterline as the central visual element while visually minimizing the surrounding dryness.ScreenshotAbove: Children walk through a thin reflective puddle in bright sun. The tents and crates behind them are dry, indicating that the scene is staged for emotional effect rather than documenting widespread flooding.Conclusion:A Visual Narrative Engineered for SympathyAcross all eight images, the pattern is consistent. Every image features a child. Every image isolates a shallow puddle. Every image conceals dry ground nearby. Every caption emphasizes hardship while omitting contradictory visual facts. Every photograph was taken by a photographer who entered Israel with Hamas on October 7.None of this is accidental.This is not neutral documentation.It is engineered imagery designed to evoke sympathy, imply collapse, and embed blame.The subterranean tunnel network and its impact on Gaza’s drainage systems are never mentioned. The warm weather conditions are never mentioned. The dry surroundings are never mentioned. The photographer’s October 7 infiltration is never mentioned.This investigation shows how a two-day rain event – the same type that causes brief puddling across Israeli cities each year – was transformed into a global symbol of suffering.The narrative was constructed.The images were selected.The framing was deliberate.The emotional message was engineered.Liked this article?

      "content": "Key Takeaways:Both the far right and far left increasingly promote the same “Jewish supremacy” conspiracy theory, casting Jews and Israel as uniquely powerful and responsible for global problems.Influencers and activists across the political spectrum – from Joe Rogan guests to Mohammad El-Kurd, Nick Fuentes, Tucker Carlson, and online pro-Palestinian figures – amplify antisemitic tropes portraying Jews or “Zionists” as controlling U.S. politics and society.This shared rhetoric now extends to Holocaust revisionism and Hitler sanitization, revealing how modern antisemitism disguises itself as moral critique while seeking to delegitimize Jewish identity and the Jewish state.There has long been a concerted effort to cloak the hatred of Jews as a righteous movement. The belief that the world would be a better place if the Jewish people just blended in a little bit more, gave up key aspects of their identity, and essentially altogether stopped being Jewish, has roots dating back centuries.This paradigm continues to exist today. The Jewish people worldwide are held to standards that no other people are held to. They are told that their identity and their connection to their land – if they are even granted the acknowledgement of their inherent connection to Israel in the first place – is the source of malignancy. If the Jewish people could only give this up, as the claim goes, society would be fixed.Just as this prejudice has existed throughout time, it also knows no political boundaries. Both extreme left and right-wing activists and influencers online have indulged in this specific form of Jew hatred.Jewish Supremacy and Political ConspiraciesThe belief that Jews exercise some form of control over the West, and particularly American politics, existed long before the terrorist attacks of October 7, 2023. After the attacks, however, blaming the Jewish people as the perpetrators of not only the war but also other societal issues globally became more visible.On the right, this has become a persistent topic in podcasts. OnThe Joe Rogan Show, Ian Caroll, an anti-Israel conspiracy theorist – who has previouslyclaimed the U.S. is controlledby a “Zionist mafia” – was interviewed in March 2025. During the conversation, Rogan provided Caroll with a platform for unadulterated antisemitic rhetoric, including the claim that Israel was tied to a “Jewish mob.” Rogan at one point acknowledged, “What’s interesting is you can talk about this now, post-Oct. 7, post-Gaza.”Similarly, on Piers Morgan Uncensored,Dan Bilzerian, yet another anti-Israel right-wing conspiracy theorist, claimed that “Jewish supremacy is the greatest threat to the world today.”View this post on InstagramA post shared by HonestReporting (@honestreporting)It is no surprise that Jewish supremacy comments are coming from extreme right-wing spaces. In 2024,75% of white supremacist propagandain the U.S. had anti-Israel or anti-Zionist messaging on it. Of all incidents reported, Israel-related antisemitic incidents accounted for more than fifty percent. Still, thevast majority of American Jewsdescribe themselves as connected to Israel.Yet, the comments about Jewish supremacy are not confined to the far right. Left-wing pro-Palestinian activists, such as Mohammad El-Kurd, express the same belief.We need to have an honest conversation about Jewish Supremacy— Mohammed El-Kurd (@m7mdkurd)November 13, 2025El-Kurd claims that he doesn’t mean Jewish supremacy in a “weird Islamist way,” but rather he claims it to be the “belief that antisemitism is a unique form of evil that is more morally urgent than all other kinds of racism.”But the undeniable rise in antisemitism is absolutely an urgent matter. It is not because Jews are morally superior to other minorities as El-Kurd implies, but because they do face a consistent and unique form of hatred.Another activist, Dr. Rahmeh Aladwan,excitedly agreedwith El-Kurd’s statement, saying that “Jewish exceptionalism can drive Jewish supremacy.” Interestingly, Aladwan has recently argued that the pro-Palestinian movement should never have been aligned with the left and is actually a “fundamentally right-wing” movement because its “motivations are rooted in nationalism, religious faith, and cultural preservation” – values historically rooted in conservative society.El-Kurd argued that this assertion was “both historically inaccurate and categorically wrong.” Yet it brings the pro-Palestinian activist space to an interesting crossroads of identity politics. This tension exposes a deeper ideological confusion within pro-Palestinian activism. While its rhetoric has long been packaged as progressive, many of its core motivations align more closely with right-wing frameworks.What is certain is that both the far left and the far right share the underlying belief in a supposed “Jewish supremacy” which casts Jews and the Jewish state as simultaneously in control of society and the source of society’s problems. It is a narrative that transcends political labels and ultimately unites these disparate factions.The Jewish supremacy claim is often cloaked in the conspiracy theory that Zionists are in control of the U.S. Self-proclaimed “ex-Israeli, anti-Zionist,” Alon Mizrahi, has claimed that “Zionists rule your civilization,” which resulted in Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation from Congress. He went on to suggest that Tucker Carlson and Nick Fuentes will be next. Greene’s stepping down from Congress has nothing to do with a Zionist or Israeli plot to control the U.S., but more to do with her ownextreme messaging.Nick Fuentes has similarly asserted that no matter whether someone identifies with the right or the left, they are unable to criticize Israel, as it is the one group “outside accountability” in cancel culture. Because of this supposed control over American politicians, Fuentes believes that anyone who disagrees with Israel or the Jewish people will lose their platform or career, due to the Jewish people’s supposedpowerin American society.Tucker Carlson, beyondhosting Nick Fuenteson his podcast, has also defended Fuentes’s supposed analysis that Israel controls U.S. politics, saying that anyone who disagrees with this control iscalled a Naziand shut down.Unsurprisingly, pro-Palestinian activist Guy Christensen – known as YourFavoriteGuy online – hasmade similar claimsthat the “Zionist machine” redefined antisemitism to include criticism of Israel, and fired anyone in the U.S. Congress who disagreed with Israel. What Christensen ignores is that theIHRA definition of antisemitism– the most widely recognized definition worldwide – explicitly states that criticism of Israel comparable to that leveled at any country is not considered antisemitic.This Jewish power trope that once belonged primarily to white supremacist discourse now circulates freely on the left, uniting two ideological opposites through a shared conspiratorial framework. As such, a narrative bridge is being forged that connects the far right and far left.When these activists eventually face the consequences of their antisemitic beliefs, it won’t be because of supposed Jewish control over them, but rather the predictable outcome of this dangerous rhetoric.Sanitization of Hitler and the NazisBeyond conspiracy theories, the sanitizing of Hitler and the Nazi regime has spread to infect both the far left and far right.On a now-deleted episode of theFresh & Fit podcast, guests discussed how the “Jews were up to something so the Germans wanted to take them out” and Hitler “was trying to save the world.”“What if the Jews did something to the Germans”, “Hitler was trying to save the world”, “How do we take [the Jews] down?”, “Genocide.”This isn’t 1940s Germany — it’s a 2025 podcast.Suzette, a recent culinary high school grad from south Florida goes full Nazi and Pompano-based…pic.twitter.com/BU0jsB4dWF— Canary Mission (@canarymission)July 24, 2025Tucker Carlson, while claiming not to support Hitler, has similarly made revisionist statements about the Nazis, recentlycondemning the 1944 assassination attempton Hitler and suggesting that killing him would have been an un-Christian act. By framing the assassination as morally questionable, Carlson obscures historical reality and lends moral equivocation to one of history’s greatest crimes.This revisionism is not confined to online spaces. Copies of Mein Kampf have been found in Hamas bases in the Gaza Strip, underscoring how extremist narratives about Hitler continue to circulate globally and influence multiple ideological movements.Never again is NOW.IDF forces discovered a copy of Hitler’s infamous book “Mein Kampf”—translated into Arabic—in a child’s bedroom used as a Hamas terrorist base in Gaza.The book was discovered among the personal belongings of one of the terrorists, featuring annotations and…pic.twitter.com/XMOE3jgKmm— Israel Defense Forces (@IDF)November 12, 2023Jew-hatred has become a morally righteous act for those who indulge in it. Whether on the right or the left of the political spectrum, antisemitism disguises itself as a just cause, pleading with the world to make changes to improve society. But the changes it asks the world to make are much more insidious. They seek to dismantle the legitimacy of Jewish identity, erase support for the Jewish state, and normalize the scapegoating of the Jewish people for societal problems. Under the guise of morality, this rhetoric spreads hate while masquerading as virtue, making it all the more dangerous and difficult to confront.Liked this article?
