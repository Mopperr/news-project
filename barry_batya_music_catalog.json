In this captivating performance, Barry and Batya Segal bring their unique style to a spiritual masterpiece, celebrating the Sabbath as a day of rest, freedom, and renewal.\n\n\"Dror Yikra\" was written by Dunash ben Labrat, a 10th-century poet and linguist who studied under Rabbi Sa'adia Ga'on. It is regarded as the first song written specifically for Shabbat, highlighting themes of spiritual redemption and the sacred bond between the people of Israel and the Sabbath.\n\nThe song reached new audiences through the historic performance by Shlomo Bar and the Natural Choice (Habreira Hativ’eet) more than 30 years ago. This adaptation featured a traditional Yemenite melody, bringing \"Dror Yikra\" into the cultural mainstream and reaffirming its place as a beloved part of Jewish heritage.\n\n\"Dror Yikra\" reflects the Sabbath as a time for spiritual renewal and liberation—a foretaste of the world to come. Just as the Sabbath and the people of Israel protect one another, this sacred day offers freedom from routine and a connection to divine purpose.\n\nDon’t forget to like, comment, and subscribe for more inspiring performances and timeless music!\n\n\n#DrorYikra #ShabbatSongs #BarryAndBatyaSegal #JewishMusic #HebrewPoetry #Sabbath #spiritualredemption \n\nTranslation:\n\nHe will proclaim freedom for all His children\nAnd will keep you as the apple of His eye\nPleasant is your name and will not be destroyed\nRepose and rest on the Sabbath day\n\nSeek my sanctuary and my home\n\nVisit: https://www.barryandbatyasegal.com/\n\n#BarryAndBatyaMusic #WorshipInHebrew #SupportIsrael\n\nSupport Vision for Israel!\nJoin us in making a difference: https://www.visionforisrael.com/en",

      "description": "This 17th-century Jewish poem (piyut), authored by Rabbi Sa'adya ben Amram, has endured as a cherished song across generations. \n\nWritten in both Hebrew and Yemenite Arabic, this moving ballad reflects the deep relationship between the body and soul. \n\nIt conveys the idea that the body doesn't constrain the soul's purpose, but rather complements it. By uniting body and spirit, we can truly fulfill our divine mission. \n\nThough the soul is familiar with the bliss of heaven, the body remains grounded on earth, where we glimpse paradise. When these two elements harmonize, peace is within reach.\n\nSapari – Won’t You Tell\n\"Won’t you tell me, pure one,\nWon’t you tell, and let us rejoice in Teiman (Yemen).\"\n\nThe poem speaks of wisdom and royalty, asking where the beloved is. The dove replies that she is in faraway lands, her heart at sea, yet her spirit is draped in glory. The imagery of wandering through labyrinths and ivory chambers reflects a journey of spiritual awakening. The pure soul is called to rise from darkness and embrace the sacred union, resisting worldly temptations.\n\n\nBarry and Batya Segal, co-founders of Vision for Israel, work to combat the growing poverty in Israel, spreading the love of Yeshua by addressing the physical and emotional needs of the people in practical ways.

      "description": "Traditional Yemenite folk song. Lyrics: Rabbi Sa'adya ben Amram.\n\nThis 17th-century Jewish poem (piyut) was written by Rabbi Sa'adya ben Amram and has remained a beloved song throughout history. With both Hebrew and Yemenite Arabic, this beautiful ballad is an ode to the connection between body and soul. It is a testament to how the body and mind are one; our bodies do not limit our soul’s purpose, but rather support it. We must merge these parts of ourselves to fully serve our ultimate purpose. While our souls know the bliss of heaven, our bodies must remain on earth where we may only learn of paradise. When the two are in harmony, we can know peace. \n\nSapari – Won’t You Tell\nWon’t you tell me, pure and innocent one, \nWon’t you tell, and we’ll rejoice in Teiman (Yemen)\n\nYou’re a princess steeped in wisdom, \nBut where are you, won’t you tell me?\nOh Se’adya! Then the dove will say \nI’m in kingdoms high and far away…. \nOn a ship at sea, my heart will stay \nBut my spirit’s draped in glory…\nIn a labyrinth you will wander \nIvory chambers deep to ponder… \nFrom the darkest places under \nYou will rise, pure one, and hear me.\nFor in truth, the choice is given \nWill you choose the sacred union? \nDon’t be thrown off by temptation! \nHoly daughter, and may it not trespass my border\n\nVision for Israel co-founders, Barry and Batya Segal, work to affect the alarming rise of poverty in Israel and effectively reach people with the love of Yeshua by meeting their physical and emotional needs in practical ways.
