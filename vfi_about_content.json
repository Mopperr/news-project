He knew that something had to be done to prepare—to provide for the poor and needy, who would be hit hardest by the instability. Along with his wife Batya, he founded Vision for Israel with this lofty mission in mind. This young ministry began reaching out and offering financial aid to poor and needy families around Israel. A couple of short years later, the story took a tragic turn when the Segal family was touched by the pain that affected many Israelis. Barry and Batya's daughter lost three teenage friends in a bus that was attacked by a Hamas suicide bomber. In addition to this loss, another girl who served as a soldier in one of the platoons she instructed was killed in a separate attack on the same bus route.

      "quote": "We have been in cahoots with Barry & Batya since... 1998. A big heart for Yeshua, worship, the nation of Israël, and the poor and needy in The Land always seem to go hand in hand in the Segal's lives, combined with a clear prophetic message about the church & the place of Israël in these end times. We have seen firsthand how big their vision is and how incredibly hard they work. The fact that Vision for Israél and The Joseph Storehouse is allowed to distribute goods even in times of lockdown, speaks volumes to their high standing with government officials across the board.",

Integrity is so important today and my years of observation of Barry and Batya, and the work they do through Vision for Israel, is that integrity is the key. No airs and graces. No superstar celebrities. Just working hard for the Lord they service. As they combine worship and teaching and service to the community throughout Israel, I see the hand of God upon them and their lives. I am blessed to recommend their work to others.",
