- Official Spotify embed widget
- Beautiful UI with album artwork

✅ YOUTUBE VIDEO (Secondary)
----------------------------
- 1 verified working video: "You Are Holy"
- Plays full video for free
- No login required
- Embedded via video modal

WHY ONLY 1 YOUTUBE VIDEO?
--------------------------
Most Barry & Batya Segal music videos are:
- Private/unlisted on YouTube
- Part of paid music albums
- Region-restricted
- Available primarily on Spotify

This is NORMAL for professional music artists who distribute through
streaming platforms rather than free YouTube content.

❌ WHAT'S NOT POSSIBLE:
-----------------------
✗ Cannot play full Spotify songs without Spotify account
✗ Cannot bypass Spotify authentication via Python
✗ Cannot stream full copyrighted music for free
✗ Python Spotify API only provides 30-second previews

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
-------------------------
1. Spotify Artist Embed - iframe integration
2. YouTube video player - existing modal system
3. Hybrid approach gives users maximum flexibility
4. Clean, professional UI with both platforms

RESULT:
-------
✓ Professional integration of their music
✓ Legal and official streaming
✓ Best user experience
✓ Access to full discography (via Spotify)
✓ Free preview option (YouTube video)
