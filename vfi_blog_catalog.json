The past year was marked by trials: the terrible massacre on October 7th in 2023, a continuing war on multiple fronts, and the resulting economic hardships that have shaken the nation to its core. Prices are rising, budgets are shrinking, and more families than ever are struggling to meet their basic needs.Vision for Israel is taking bold action to address the ongoing economic crisis. In 2024, our budget exceeded expectations, and through God’s provision and your faithful support, we met our financial goals. For 2025, we are increasing the budget even further. This is an ambitious step, but the need is urgent, and we cannot wait. Together, we can make a lasting impact on the lives of thousands in need.Here are the goals we are striving to achieve this year:\n\nThe numbers tell a sobering story: nearly one in five families in Israel now lives below the poverty line, facing daily battles with deprivation, debt, and despair. Entire communities have been uprooted, and thousands are coping with the scars of war, struggling to find their footing. Without intervention, the economic forecast for 2025 could leave even more families in poverty, and we cannot allow that to happen.Your generosity makes a tangible difference! Last year, your contributions brought food, medical supplies, and emergency aid to thousands of people in need. This year, we must do even more.We ask for your prayers and your support as we tackle these immense challenges. Please consider making a gift today to help us reach our new goals. And if it’s on your heart to become a monthly donor, your impact will go even further. Every donation is a seed of hope, planted in faith that God will bring restoration to the people of Israel.With your help, we can make 2025 a year of healing, hope, and new beginnings for those who need it most.\n\nPlease give generously today at VisionforIsrael.com.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,It's important to keep our minds and hearts open to opportunities to save lives.\n\nGod is always asking us to do good.\n\nNo matter what evil or hardship we are experiencing, we should always look for opportunities to help others and spread God’s love and light to those we meet.Sometimes, it can be hard to see the opportunities that God presents us with. We are often so busy with our own lives and our own worries that we miss opportunities to do good, even if they are right in front of us.A few years ago, a director of one of the welfare departments approached us to help a family in serious distress. Her request was clear: the family (parents and four children) will be thrown into the street in a few days. The mother of the family had served in the police force when she experienced a terror attack. Since then, she developed severe PTSD and had been receiving a disability pension when suddenly, without any notice, the payments stopped. The family had committed to certain payments and suddenly they had no income.In desperation, the father of the family begged the bank not to close their account and promised to pay the debt that existed there. Meanwhile, no one was listening to him. He was alone in the war against the bank. Eventually, he was told that they will not be able to extend the time for the payment to cover the debt. This time they told him he would have to vacate their little humble apartment.This man intended to lock up the whole family in the apartment and end the mental suffering the only way he felt he had left. We realized that this was really about saving human lives. Vision for Israel gave them significant financial assistance, and the family underwent an economic and emotional rehabilitation process.Last year, at the bar/bat mitzvah celebration we hosted at the Millennium Center, we met the family. It was such a joy to see them again after a few years—especially as the son now gets to celebrate his bar mitzvah. For us, it was closing a circle to see the family stand on its own two feet after undergoing a healthy process of economic and mental rehabilitation.These days, we are preparing to bless 50 teenage boys and girls from terror survivor families with a Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebration. This event is extremely important for Jewish young people, but sadly not everyone gets to experience it. The youth we serve have all been through terrible tragedies—whether it be a terror attack, the loss of one or both parents, or something equally horrifying. We believe that God wants these dear ones to enjoy their Bar or Bat Mitzvah, so we do what we can to give them that opportunity.Vision for Israel is co-sponsoring this special event, which includes gifts and festivities. During this day the children and their families will enjoy breakfast, prayers, and activities at the Western Wall, a festive lunch with entertainment, and wonderful gifts, both modern and traditional. At the end of the day, everyone will meet at the President's house. The total cost of the day's event is about $60,000.You can make a change!Our prayer is that you, our partners and friends, see this as an opportunity to get involved. Though there is so much suffering and pain in the world, there will always be the opportunity to spread God’s love. We can choose to focus on what we have lost, or we can choose to focus on the good we can do. Your continued support and sponsorship is a way to make a change in the lives of the next generation.We hope that you will join us in blessing these dear children.May the Lord bless and keep you.Batya and Barry Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nLast week, Vision for Israel was delighted to conclude yet another cultural event supporting Victims of Hostilities.\n\nIn cooperation with the Representative Organization of Victims of Hostilities, we held a cultural evening at the Arts Center in the neighborhood of Pisgat Ze'ev in Jerusalem.About 307 survivors of hostilities and 35 Holocaust survivors (invited by Vision for Israel) came to watch the musical \"Bustan Sephardi\" (Spanish Garden) by the Habima Theater, directed by Tzadi Tzarfati.For victims of hostility, the ongoing effects of trauma, PTSD, and loneliness are just some of the burdensome wounds which they fight to heal every day. Finding relief amid such intense healing is often a hard task for many, as even keeping up with the basic tasks can be daunting.For that reason, we took it upon ourselves to organize an evening in which, for a few precious hours, they could enjoy a life-giving evening full of laughter and entertainment.We kicked the evening off by registering all who came and meeting them face to face. Greeting them, taking their names, and distributing their tickets for the play allowed us to say, without many words: \"We see you\".After that, we were delighted to see the sparkle in their eyes and the smile on their face as we then handed out gift baskets filled to the brim with pampering products such as hand cream, body lotion, body wash, and body butter, all gifted by \"Sabon shel Pa'am\".We then moved on to enjoy a casual time of connection and conversation over a selection of light refreshments - coffee, tea, soft drinks, cakes, and sweet and savory pastries.Coming out of a long period of Covid restrictions in which we could not gather in groups, it was great fun to see the hall filled with people and hear the sounds of laughter and joy before the show.During and after the play, many came to thank us, expressing their enjoyment of the play, the gift baskets, and our kindness.\n\nA representative of the Holocaust survivors said that even after the lights went out and all went home, some of the survivors called later on to say thank you and express their enjoyment of the play and how respected they felt as we gave them the best and most accessible seats in the house!VFI was privileged to donate the refreshments, means of transportation for the participants, a photographer to document their smiles, as well as cover half the cost of the play.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIf you’ve been following us for a while, you have probably seen how we love food and cooking. And if any of you have traveled around the world, you know that trying different foods is one of the best ways to learn about different cultures. So we want to invite you into our Israeli kitchen, so you can experience the tastes of Israel and at the same time learn about Israeli culture. Put your apron on and let’s hop into the kitchen!In honor of Shavuot, we want to share with you a recipe for a classic Israeli cheesecake. But let’s first start with a short history of Shavuot. This holiday is also known as the Feast of Weeks or Pentecost. It is a Jewish celebration exactly 50 days after Passover and commemorates when God gave Moses the 10 commandments. During this holiday, God commanded the Jewish people to celebrate with the first fruits of the wheat harvest.\n\nIn the modern culture of Israel today, there are several traditions during this holiday. Many celebrate the first night of Shavuot with two meals because in Leviticus it says to give two loaves of bread as a first fruit offering to the Lord. Therefore, the first meal they have is all dairy and after waiting, then they will have a second meal with meat. It is also tradition to go to the synagogue and stay up through the night reading the book of Ruth.As you walk the streets throughout Israel leading up to Shavuot, you will see that the main traditional food for this holiday is dairy recipes. Many believe this is because the nation of Israel is known as the land of milk and honey. So to help you celebrate Shavuot in the best way, we want to give you one of our favorite dairy recipes. In our opinion there is no Shavuot holiday meal without the star of the show — cheesecake. There are a variety of cheesecakes in Israel. Some have a crust made of crushed cookies and some are topped with cream, fruit, or with additional cookie crumbs. Some are encased in dough. Some are baked and some are not. And there are many different varieties of cheeses used inside the cake, as well. The classic Israeli cheesecake is airy and light with no crust. This is very different from the famous New York cheesecake. However, it is also very tasty. This crustless cheesecake is very famous in Israel and it takes some skill to produce a tall one without cracks. Every family has its own go-to recipe, and we found this one that we really like.As we will be sharing many more recipes with you, we thought there was no better recipe to start with, than with dessert. We hope that you’ll enjoy making this recipe! Send us your comments and tell us how your cheesecake turned out.\n\nIngredients:\n\n7 large eggs at room temperature1 1/4 cup sugar3 Tbsp instant vanilla pudding powder20 gr vanilla sugar (or 1 1/3 Tbsp sugar + 2 tsp. vanilla extract)5 Tbsp cornstarch750 gr Skyr cheese 200 ml (or 204 gr) sour creamPinch of saltButter for pan\n\nDirections:Prepare the baking pan:\n\n1. Grease the bottom and sides of a spring-form pan (22 cm in diameter) with butter. Trace a circle of the pan on baking paper, making it slightly larger. Cut it out and place it on the bottom of the pan. Press the parchment circle to the inside of the pan and slightly up the sides all around until it is completely covered. (It’s important that the whole bottom is covered with baking paper in order to extract the cake in its entirety.) Generously grease the top of the parchment well with butter.\n\nMake the cheesecake:\n\n2. Preheat the oven to 200°C/390°F.\n\n3. Separate the eggs into two bowls.\n\n4. In a large bowl, mix the egg yolks, the cheese, and the sour cream into a smooth mixture.\n\n5. Sift the pudding powder, vanilla sugar, and cornstarch into the cheese mixture. Mix well with a whisk, until the batter is smooth.\n\n6. In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt. When the foam begins to form, add the sugar in 3-4 batches while whipping. Continue until a very stable, white, and shiny foam is obtained.\n\n7. Pour a third of the egg white mixture into the cheese mixture and fold from bottom to top in a wrapping motion. Add another third and continue until combined. Add the rest of the foam and fold in a wrapping motion.\n\n8. Pour the mixture into the pan and gently knock it on the counter to level the batter. Cover the bottom of the pan with a double layer of aluminum foil.\n\n9. Place a large baking pan on the lowest rack in the oven and fill it halfway with boiling water. Place the cheesecake pan inside it. Bake for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 150°C/300°F and continue baking for another 45-60 minutes. The cake is ready when it’s golden on top. It’s important not to open the oven throughout the baking time to avoid cracks.\n\n10. Turn the oven off, and leave the cake in the oven for at least 30 minutes to let it rest and stabilize completely.\n\n11. Take the cake out to cool completely for at least two hours at room temperature.\n\nRemove the cake from the pan:12. After cooling the cake on the counter for 2 hours, place the face of a plate or platter on the pan. Then lift and turn it over. Take another plate (the plate you want to place your cake) and place it on top of the cake. Lift and turn it over again, so that the face of the cake is on top.\n\n13. Place the cake in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. It’s recommended to prepare the cake a day in advance. The cake is best served very cold. You can top it with berries or whipped cream. Slice and enjoy!\n\nWe hope you enjoy this delicious cake.Blessings from Jerusalem!",

It is also tradition to go to the synagogue and stay up through the night reading the book of Ruth.<br/><br/>As you walk the streets throughout Israel leading up to Shavuot, you will see that the main traditional food for this holiday is dairy recipes.  Many believe this is because the nation of Israel is known as the land of milk and honey. So to help you celebrate Shavuot in the best way, we want to give you one of our favorite dairy recipes. In our opinion there is no Shavuot holiday meal without the star of the show —  cheesecake. <br/><br/>There are a variety of cheesecakes in Israel. Some have a crust made of crushed cookies and some are topped with cream, fruit, or with additional cookie crumbs. Some are encased in dough. Some are baked and some are not. And there are many different varieties of cheeses used inside the cake, as well.  <br/><br/>The classic Israeli cheesecake is airy and light with no crust. This is very different from the famous New York cheesecake. However, it is also very tasty. This crustless cheesecake is very famous in Israel and it takes some skill to produce a tall one without cracks. Every family has its own go-to recipe, and we found this one that we really like.<br/><br/>As we will be sharing many more recipes with you, we thought there was no better recipe to start with, than with dessert. We hope that you’ll enjoy making this recipe! Send us your comments and tell us how your cheesecake turned out.</p><p><strong>Ingredients:  </strong></p><p>7 large eggs at room temperature<br/>1 1/4 cup sugar<br/>3 Tbsp instant vanilla pudding powder<br/>20 gr vanilla sugar (or 1 1/3 Tbsp sugar + 2 tsp. vanilla extract)<br/>5 Tbsp cornstarch<br/>750 gr Skyr cheese <br/>200 ml (or 204 gr) sour cream<br/>Pinch of salt<br/><br/>Butter for pan</p><p><strong>Directions:</strong><br/>Prepare the baking pan: </p><p>1.  Grease the bottom and sides of a spring-form pan (22 cm in diameter) with butter. Trace a circle of the pan on baking paper, making it slightly larger. Cut it out and place it on the bottom of the pan. Press the parchment circle to the inside of the pan and slightly up the sides all around until it is completely covered. (It’s important that the whole bottom is covered with baking paper in order to extract the cake in its entirety.) Generously grease the top of the parchment well with butter.</p><p>Make the cheesecake: </p><p>2.  Preheat the oven to 200°C/390°F. </p><p>3.  Separate the eggs into two bowls. </p><p>4.  In a large bowl, mix the egg yolks, the cheese, and the sour cream into a smooth mixture.</p><p>5.  Sift the pudding powder, vanilla sugar, and cornstarch into the cheese mixture. Mix well with a whisk, until the batter is smooth.</p><p>6.  In a separate large bowl, beat the egg whites with a pinch of salt. When the foam begins to form, add the sugar in 3-4 batches while whipping. Continue until a very stable, white, and shiny foam is obtained.</p><p>7.  Pour a third of the egg white mixture into the cheese mixture and fold from bottom to top in a wrapping motion. Add another third and continue until combined. Add the rest of the foam and fold in a wrapping motion.</p><p>8.  Pour the mixture into the pan and gently knock it on the counter to level the batter. Cover the bottom of the pan with a double layer of aluminum foil.</p><p>9.  Place a large baking pan on the lowest rack in the oven and fill it halfway with boiling water. Place the cheesecake pan inside it. Bake for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 150°C/300°F and continue baking for another 45-60 minutes. The cake is ready when it’s golden on top. <strong>It’s important not to open the oven throughout the baking time to avoid cracks.</strong></p><p>10.  Turn the oven off, and leave the cake in the oven for at least 30 minutes to let it rest and stabilize completely.</p><p>11.  Take the cake out to cool completely for at least two hours at room temperature.</p><p>Remove the cake from the pan:<br/>12.  After cooling the cake on the counter for 2 hours, place the face of a plate or platter on the pan. Then lift and turn it over. Take another plate (the plate you want to place your cake) and place it on top of the cake. Lift and turn it over again, so that the face of the cake is on top.</p><p>13.  Place the cake in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. It’s recommended to prepare the cake a day in advance. The cake is best served very cold. You can top it with berries or whipped cream. Slice and enjoy!</p><p>We hope you enjoy this delicious cake.<br/><br/>Blessings from Jerusalem!</p><p>By subscribing, I agree to the <a href=\"https://www.visionforisrael.com/terms-of-use\">Terms of Use </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.visionforisrael.com/gdpr-privacy-policy\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,As you have undoubtedly heard, Israel has been under attack. For those of us living in Israel, rocket attacks from Gaza are not uncommon—but the scale, severity, and range of targets involved in these latest attacks has truly been unprecedented.As of last Monday night (May 10), we are in a state of emergency and escalation in the area surrounding Gaza and the south as a whole. The towns of southern Israel, over 30 of them, including the cities of Sderot, Ashkelon, and Ashdod have been suffering for 20 years from rounds of rocket fire and terrorist incidents of intrusion attempts, incendiary balloons, anti-tank fire, and more—but the current round is extreme in its abilities and quantity. Over 3,200* missiles have been fired so far at the southern, coastal, and central regions in Israel.Innocent civilians’ lives are in danger.Once a siren is heard, there are only 15-45 seconds (depending on where the target is) to enter a protected area. It is not much time. If people are in a public area—on their way to work, to shop, or take their kids to school—they need a shelter nearby to enter and protect their lives.We are being urgently asked to help and provide lifesaving equipment designed for these emergencies, to provide public protection; mobile shelters, emergency locking systems, and bomb blast doors.Gershon Franko, a 56-year-old man lost his life as a direct hit from a rocket shot by the terror group Hamas; he had nowhere to go and there was no public mobile shelter near his place. He was murdered simply because he had nowhere to run and hide.During the year the public shelters must remain clean so in time of emergencies, they can be used and protect civilians in their cities. That is when the “Gate Keeper” system was also added to the mobile shelters.The mobile shelter \"Gate Keeper\" system—is an automatic open and lock system installed in a network of portable bomb shelters that are placed throughout the cities, which unlocks and opens automatically in times of emergency.Quite literally, it’s a matter of life and death for all peoples of Israel.Please join us as we are reaching out to the cities in the southern region of Israel with whatever you are able to donate in order to save the lives of innocent people during these horrific rocket attacks.As a partner in our mission with Vision for Israel, we pray that those of you with the means to do so will listen to the call to give and donate towards this project.Together, we will weather this storm and come back stronger—in our faith and our love for one another.\n\nUnder His Wings,\n\nBarry and Batya *The numbers of rockets are changing hourly.

      "title": "A Father’s Courage in the Face of Terror",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,This month’s Israel in Focus brings you one of the many untold stories of courage and heartbreak from October 7, one that did not make headlines for long but has left a permanent mark on the heart of a nation. Their horrific terror experience reminds us why our support continues to bless those who have emotional injuries. We believe it is time to restore dignity, hope, and healing across this land, and to stand in prayerful solidarity with the people of Israel.Omri Miran, 48, is a father, a husband, a therapist, and now, a former hostage. He lived in Kibbutz Nahal Oz with his wife Lishai and their two daughters, Roni and Alma. A few years ago, Omri and Lishai met at a Purim party in Sderot. It was March 2020, days before the world shut down for COVID, and the two formed a fast and deep connection. They married, started a family, and built a life just kilometers from the Gaza border, a life filled with joy and simplicity.Omri had a small studio where he offered shiatsu therapy and also worked as a construction laborer on the kibbutz. He was a man who used his hands to build, to heal, and to serve his community.On the morning of October 7, 2023, that quiet life was shattered.At 10:30 a.m., the window above the shower exploded. Outside, footsteps and shouts in Arabic filled the air. Terrorists had entered the kibbutz. The family held their breath as the chaos crept closer. Then came a voice they knew: “It’s me, Tomer. Please open the door, or they will shoot you and me.” It was 17-year-old Tomer Arava, their neighbor’s son, used by the attackers as a human shield.Omri and Lishai made a desperate decision. Their daughter, Roni, had fallen asleep just in front of the door. If gunmen opened fire, she would be the first to suffer. Omri opened the door.Armed terrorists stormed in and forced the family into the living room. Then they were marched to a nearby home belonging to the Idan family. Already grieving the murder of their daughter, Ma’ayan, the Idans now share in the unfolding horror. Roni, just a toddler, was paralyzed with fear. Alma, only six months old, cried with hunger. The gunmen demanded that Lishai breastfeed Alma for a photo. She refused.At around 1:30 p.m., the scene shifted again. More terrorists arrived, this time with Yehudit and Natalie Ra’anan, a mother and daughter from Chicago who had come to visit. The gunmen bound the hands of Omri and Tzachi. Lishai realized what was about to happen. She wasn’t allowed to approach him, so she did what any wife and mother would do. She spoke words that carried the weight of their love and the hope of survival:“I love you. I will protect our girls. I am waiting for you… ”He was taken hostage with great violence by the terrorists.Roni screamed, “Abba! I want my dad!” She tried to run after him, wild with grief. At just two years old, she understood the terror in the room. By 5:30 p.m., after eleven unbearable hours, IDF soldiers from the Givati Brigade stormed the building and rescued the remaining family members. But Omri had already been taken hostage into Gaza.For 738 days, Omri was a hostage who was tortured by hamas terror group. Omri was moved between 23 different locations, held both above ground and in Hamas’ tunnels. Early on, he was shackled. For three weeks, he could not walk freely. At one point, five hostages were crammed into a cage only 1.80 by 1.60 meters. They could not stand upright. They could barely breathe. They were starved. They gave them dirty, salty seawater to drink. Slowly, one by one, the other men were taken, leaving Omri and one other hostage alone.There were moments when the terrorists left weapons nearby, an invitation to make a desperate move. But Omri knew it would not lead to freedom. It would only make things worse.To hold on to his sanity, Omri marked each day in his mind. He never wrote it down. He simply counted. He knew exactly how many days had passed.But the thing that truly kept him going was imagining the simplest things: playing with Roni, holding Alma, hearing their laughter, being near his wife again. He focused on those moments, those blessings, because they reminded him that there was still life to return to.A message finally reached his family on Yom HaShoah, Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day. It was also his birthday. A sign of life. A heartbeat of hope.Then, on October 13, 2025, Omri Miran was released. He returned to his wife and daughters. The family moved to a semi-temporary home in Kramim—Omri, free and breathing fresh air once more.One week later, Omri spoke publicly for the first time. He said:\"I returned to Israel, to life, and I discovered that everyone knows me. I don’t know each and every one of you, but I saw you. I got glimpses of the fight you waged for me and the other hostages. I saw you standing in the square, at intersections, all over the country, and for that, people of Israel, a huge thank you. I have no words to describe how much I love you and appreciate you for not giving up on us.\"He expressed deep gratitude to the IDF, the security services, and the people of Israel. And then he made a vow: to do everything in his power until the last hostage comes home.Today, Omri is healing. Roni is now 4 years old. Alma is two. Their family is together again. But they are forever changed.We share this story not to stir fear, but to stir faith.Omri’s story represents resilience and hope. Although we cannot undo the darkness of that day, together we can light candles of hope in homes across Israel. We can stand with the brokenhearted. We can proclaim freedom and restoration.Please continue to pray for every released hostage, every family, and for peace to reign over Israel.If you feel led, we invite you to partner with us in providing vital aid to those most in need. Give today.With gratitude,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

In order to continue expanding our reach to those in need, our vision is to develop and create a special nature garden space on the rooftop of the Millennium Center.\n\nBehold, I will bring it health and healing; I will heal them and reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth. — Jeremiah 33:6\n\nOur vision is to develop the rooftop to a garden space in order to give us the ability to host visiting groups and most importantly—to provide a space for those rehabilitating and those who seek healing. Many people in Israel have been affected by wars and terrorism and many are longing for support with our social welfare projects. A comforting place to congregate among nature is a gift to anyone and we would love to offer that in the ongoing support we provide to those we serve in the community.The cost for development of the roof top is $75 per square foot. To complete the roof and garden, we are looking to build out 4,000 square feet. If 4,000 of our generous friends considered donating $75 each, we could reach our goal in no time.Think about how we can all transform the lives of people by providing them with care in an environment that can change their future for good. Please consider joining us in this selfless mission by donating here.\n\nYour friends,Barry, Batya, and the VFI Team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThis year, Yom Ha'atzma'ut (Israel’s Independence Day) will be celebrated on April 15. According to the Jewish calendar, it's on the 5th of Iyar. As you may know, the state of Israel was established 3 short years after the Holocaust ended—and it is no coincidence that we celebrate our independence 1 week after Yom Hasho'a (Holocaust Remembrance Day), and both are commemorated soon after Passover. On Passover, we celebrate the fact that we were set free from slavery in Egypt, and on Yom Hasho'a we remember the atrocities that were done to the Jewish people in Nazi Europe. Yom Ha'atzma'ut is preceded by Yom Hazikaron (Day of Remembrance of our fallen soldiers). But how did the modern state of Israel come to be? Here’s a look at a few of the key events.\n\nDuring the First World War (1914–18), an Arab uprising against Ottoman rule and the British Empire's Egyptian Expeditionary Force under General Edmund Allenby drove the Turks out of the Levant during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. Israel was part of that region.\n\nIn Palestine, the Balfour Declaration of \"national home for the Jewish people\" was to be established alongside the Arabs who composed the vast majority of the local population. The British controlled Palestine for almost three decades, overseeing a succession of protests, riots, and revolts between the Jewish and Arab communities. During the Mandate, the area saw the rise of two nationalist movements: the Jews and the Arabs. Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine ultimately produced the 1936–39 Arab revolt in Palestine and the 1944–1948 Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine. The United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was passed on 29 November 1947; this envisioned the creation of separate Jewish and Arab states operating under economic union, and with Jerusalem transferred to UN trusteeship. Two weeks later, Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones announced that the British Mandate would end on 15 May 1948. On the last day of the Mandate, the Jewish community there issued the Israeli Declaration of Independence.\n\nOn May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the Israeli Declaration of Independence, formally declaring the establishment of the State of Israel.David Ben Gurion was the Executive Head of the World Zionist Organization, Chairman of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, and soon to be the first Prime Minister of Israel. He declared the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel, to be known as the State of Israel, which would come into effect on termination of the British Mandate at midnight that day.Within a few hours, at midnight, the new state of Israel was facing its first war as an established state. The War of Independence broke.\n\nThe first deaths of the war occurred on 30 November 1947 during an ambush of two buses carrying Jews. There had been tension and conflict between the Arabs and the Jews, and between each of them and the British forces since the 1917 Balfour Declaration and the 1920 creation of the British Mandate of Palestine.As a result of the war, the State of Israel controlled the area that UN General Assembly Resolution 181 had recommended for the proposed Jewish state, as well as almost 60% of the area of Arab state proposed by the 1947 Partition Plan, including the Jaffa, Lydda, and Ramle areas, the Galilee, some parts of the Negev, a wide strip along the Tel Aviv–Jerusalem road, West Jerusalem, and some territories in the West Bank (Judea and Samaria regions), Transjordan took control of the remainder of the former British mandate, which it annexed, and the Egyptian military took control of the Gaza Strip.In the three years following the war, about 700,000 Jews emigrated to Israel. Around 260,000 Jews moved to Israel from the Arab world during and immediately after the war. They were either fleeing due to rising antisemitism or being expelled.\n\nThe official “switch” from Yom Hazikaron to Yom Ha’atzmaut takes place a few minutes after sundown, with a ceremony on Mount Herzl in Jerusalem in which the flag is raised from half-staff (due to Memorial Day) to the top of the pole. The president of Israel delivers a speech of congratulations, and soldiers representing the Army, Navy, and Air Force parade with their flags. In recent decades this small-scale parade has replaced the large-scale daytime parade, which was the main event during the 1950s and ’60s. The evening parade is followed by a torch lighting (hadlakat masu’ot) ceremony, which marks the country’s achievements in all spheres of life. Other than the official ceremonies, Israelis celebrate Yom Ha’atzmaut in a variety of ways. In the cities, the nighttime festivities may be found on the main streets. Crowds will gather to watch public shows offered for free by the municipalities and the government. Many spend the night dancing Israeli folk dances or singing Israeli songs. During the daytime, thousands of Israeli families go out on hikes and picnics. Army camps are open for civilians to visit and to display the recent technological achievements of the Israeli Defense Forces. Yom Ha’atzmaut is concluded with the ceremony of granting the “Israel Prize” recognizing individual Israelis for their unique contribution to the country’s culture, science, arts, and humanities. In closing, friends, we ask that you join us in prayer that God will continue to bless the land and people of Israel, and that He watches over her—particularly in the coming years of conflict.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Throughout the nation of Israel, a one-minute siren will sound and everyone stops for a minute of silence. The next day around 11 am, another siren sounds and you will see cars, buses, and people stop for an entire minute wherever they are, even on the highway or in the middle of the city.As Yom Hazikaron approaches, it is important to understand that it is a day to remember not only the fallen soldiers but also the victims of terror attacks. I want to share with you a powerful testimony about one of our VFI board members, Ilan, who recently experienced a terror attack.Ilan went to Masada with his family for the day, and as they were returning to Jerusalem they stopped at a restaurant near Jericho. As they were sitting inside, Ilan looked out the window and saw two terrorists get out of a car with two guns.Without even thinking or making a noise, Ilan ran to the front door of the restaurant to block the entrance. He instinctively used his body to block the terrorists from coming inside. The terrorists tried to enter through the door, but they could not get through. They started shooting their guns in the air. Just as they were pointing their guns at the door, their guns jammed and they couldn’t shoot. Immediately, the terrorists became frustrated and fled the scene.At exactly the same time when this was happening, almost to the minute, Barry and I were praying with a group of friends. We prayed for every attempted terror attack to be thwarted and for every further attack to be obstructed by technical problems with the enemy’s guns or firearms. We were very specific in our prayers for God to confuse the enemy, make their guns inoperable, and supernaturally block any terrorist attack…And that’s EXACTLY what happened!\n\nWhen Ilan told us what happened, we got chills and were in awe of how God answered our prayers. A horrific terror attack could have happened that day, but God intervened! God gave Ilan the courage and wisdom to block the door with his body and to protect all of the people and families inside the restaurant. Ilan is a true hero. And we praise God for answering our prayers and protecting Ilan, his family, and everyone in that restaurant.Ilan's story is truly inspiring because it reminds us that NOTHING is stronger than God's power. God sees us, hears our prayers, and is a shield around His people. At VFI, we see how vital it is to support victims of terror attacks because unfortunately, it is a common occurrence here in Israel. We have seen the difficult challenges that these victims of terror attacks endure as they try to overcome the trauma. Therefore, it is our great honor to support and stand with those who have survived terror attacks here in Israel. Some of the ways we support these victims of terror are through grants towards further education, events, and celebrations for them to attend a couple of times a year, and monthly financial gifts to those in need.This Yom Hazikaron we encourage you to pray for the families of the fallen soldiers, those that have lost loved ones in terror attacks, and those who have survived terror attacks. We also hope our testimony of how God answered our prayers encourages you to pray and intercede for the protection of God’s people here in the land of Israel.

And we praise God for answering our prayers and protecting Ilan, his family, and everyone in that restaurant.<br/><br/>Ilan's story is truly inspiring because it reminds us that NOTHING is stronger than God's power. God sees us, hears our prayers, and is a shield around His people. <br/><br/>At VFI, we see how vital it is to support victims of terror attacks because unfortunately, it is a common occurrence here in Israel. We have seen the difficult challenges that these victims of terror attacks endure as they try to overcome the trauma. <br/><br/>Therefore, it is our great honor to support and stand with those who have survived terror attacks here in Israel. Some of the ways we support these victims of terror are through grants towards further education, events, and celebrations for them to attend a couple of times a year, and monthly financial gifts to those in need.<br/><br/>This Yom Hazikaron we encourage you to pray for the families of the fallen soldiers, those that have lost loved ones in terror attacks, and those who have survived terror attacks. <br/><br/>We also hope our testimony of how God answered our prayers encourages you to pray and intercede for the protection of God’s people here in the land of Israel. <br/><br/><br/>Shalom and Blessings,<br/><br/>Batya</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

Due to the massacre on October 7th, many were added to the circle of bereaved families.Because our nation is still in the middle of the war, we debated whether we should hold the event. Despite all the struggles, it was unanimously decided that it was important and worthwhile to hold the event to give the families hope and joy amid the devastation.Early Sunday morning, March 24, 2024, on Purim day, the production company and the VFI team arrived at the Millennium Center to set up all the booths and activities. We also had a designer decorate the Millennium Center and make it enjoyable for all of the guests.We welcomed the families with hot and cold drinks, fresh and healthy sandwiches, cookies, and a variety of pastries to start the event. Then the fun began with trampolines, inflatable houses, target shooting stations, juggling, masks and groggers craft stations, a drum circle workshop, a makeup station, and a balloon station.After all of these fun activities, it was time to choose from a variety of food for lunch: hamburgers, hot dogs, falafel, shredded meat and chicken sandwiches, and bars of fresh salads and homemade bread.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe unexpected and difficult war that was imposed on the nation of Israel on October 7th has affected everyone. For us, at Vision for Israel, we were affected in many ways and had to cancel and change several planned events. One of those special events that was canceled in October was a musical brunch for Holocaust survivors.As we saw the war continuing for months, we decided it was time to move forward in planning this special event for the Holocaust survivors. It was important for us to provide an opportunity for the Holocaust survivors to get out of the house, enjoy a time of fellowship together, and remind them that we care about them and have not forgotten about them, especially in the shadow of the war.Two and a half months after the start of the war, on December 27th, we hosted 45 Holocaust survivors from Jerusalem at the Millennium Center. We sponsored the transportation for them to the Millennium Center as well as the day’s activities and food. Batya, Barry, and the staff of the Holocaust Victims Welfare Fund greeted them upon their arrival.A musician played pleasant music in the background, while the Holocaust survivors enjoyed hot and cold drinks, pastries, cakes, and fruit. As the survivors sat down, Batya and Barry sang songs and welcomed them all to this wonderful event. Then a rich, healthy, and delicious brunch was served to the tables, which included special breads, tortilla rolls, a variety of spreads, and vegetables.After the meal, one of the survivors gave a moving speech, inspiring and strengthening all attendees. He spoke about the situation in the country and the parallel to the Holocaust. He emphasized that Israel is a strong country with a strong army. He pointed out that the Holocaust survivors were the ones to found this country, and the young generation is chosen to preserve and protect Israel in every possible way. Indeed, in these very moments, many of the grandchildren of the survivors are risking their lives for the safety of us all.After this meaningful moment, it was time for the main event - an interesting, exciting, and funny play featuring the history of Jerusalem and its neighborhoods. It was a one-man show. He played several characters by changing costumes, voices, and body language. Two musicians accompanied him by singing Israeli songs, including songs of Jerusalem, while the actor changed into the next character.After they had fun, laughed, sang, and were inspired, each Holocaust survivor received a warm duvet for the winter as a gift from VFI. The Holocaust survivors thanked us for the encouraging and enjoyable time they had that day. Many left our center with big smiles on their faces, and this was exactly what we were hoping for!One of the survivors especially touched our hearts, when she shared with tears in her eyes: \"I thank you so much for this day. You gave me the moments that I didn't have in my childhood, that were taken from me. I am so excited and I thank you for this moment\".We praise God for this meaningful time we had with the Holocaust survivors. We are grateful that God allowed us to help bring hope, joy, and strength to these Holocaust survivors as the war continues to rage on.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

And one of the greatest privileges we get to enjoy here at Vision for Israel is bringing the joy and magic of Purim to these dear young souls. Not every child has the opportunity to share in the festivities with their loved ones, as many children in Israel face significant challenges and hardship due to poverty, and complicated home environments.For the past several years, we’ve been supporting a particular school in Jerusalem that caters to the special needs of children just like this. And for this year’s Purim celebration, we decided to give the children a special treat.This Purim, the school celebrated with the theme \"Legendary Purim\"—the children put together activity stations relating to legends. For example, one of them was building a card tower in the Alice in Wonderland station, another was walking in high heels along a course in the Cinderella station, and yet another was an all-you-can-eat experience in the Hensel and Gretel station. At the end of each station, the children received prizes—and at the end of the day, they each left with a bag full of prizes, and a big smile on their faces. Thanks to your heroic donations, we were able to provide a humorous, full-sensory magic show, which got the kids laughing, and taking part in the fun—a sight that moved us greatly. At the end of the show, the magician made each child a balloon hat.Our hearts were especially warmed by the excitement of one boy, who we learned had been dealing with severe emotional problems. This was his first experience with the Purim celebration at the school. His enthusiasm grew with each station he completed, and he was visibly filled with joy at the magic show. None of this could have been possible without your incredible generosity, our dear partners. Thank you for helping us put smiles on the faces of these children, and for giving them a glimmer of hope—and belief—this Purim.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Maybe it was a physical ailment or a difficult situation at home or work. Whatever it was, I'm sure you remember how it felt to be in that place of need.For me, it was a recent experience with severe pain in my knee and shoulder. I found myself unable to do the things I had always taken for granted — packing and moving, driving, and even lifting a plastic bag. In an instant, I became fully dependent on another person, and it was not a pleasant feeling.But as I thought about my situation, my heart went out to all those who receive assistance and support from anyone who can help them. I thought of each of them as if they were me, and I imagined the difficulty and shame they must feel in asking for help.\n\n(Batya’s mother, Sarah, with the first great grandchild)It's important to remember that the wheel of life turns, and even if we have everything we need to live a good and happy life, even if today we are supporting others, the situation can change and we could become weak in certain ways and need help ourselves. This is humility, that in every situation we have to be in a place of patience, and compassion, and must be attentive to someone else's needs.In our generation, there is a constant preoccupation with ourselves. All social networks are full of the personal stories of so many people. Taking care of ourselves is not the only goal of our lives. Our goal is to serve and train those who need help. The constant search to find those whose cry is not heard. Those whom we don't know their difficulties because they are ashamed to ask for help. This is the most difficult task, to find the quiet and humble.We then who are strong ought to bear with the scruples of the weak, and not to please ourselves. – Romans 15:1\n\nIt is written that Job, who was supposed to be immersed in his great trouble, went to seek and find the most difficult cases, those who needed help. Not all of us can search and find, but every one of us can choose to support the weak and impoverished.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nCan you imagine the feeling of being adopted as a baby? Well, this is how *Henni’s story began. Only after being in this world for a few weeks, an ultra-Orthodox family adopted Henni. However, when Henni turned 16, she ran away from home and her family. She suffered from abuse and didn’t want to stay there anymore. As a result she found herself wandering the streets without any sense of identity and belonging. Finally, she found a safe and warm home in the center of Israel that was specifically for girls at risk. After staying there for two years, it was time to serve in the IDF. During her service, she met her future husband and soon after they got married. After the birth of their second child, the father disappeared and never came back. This left Henni feeling rejected once again and all alone. She had no time to feel sorry for herself. She had to take care of her toddler and baby with no job, no family she could turn to for help, no income, and no support. She was grateful to have her two children, but she didn’t know how she would provide for her kids or herself.\n\n“To rob the needy of justice, and to take what is right from the poor of My people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless.“ — Isaiah 10:2\n\nTrying to survive against all odds, Henni started working with elderly people. She cleaned for them and cared for their needs. It was hard and the income didn't cover the basic monthly expenses like rent, utilities and all the rest. A request from the social authorities came to assist her. Vision for Israel team visited Henni at her home. The apartment where they were living was lacking the most basic furniture, no chairs, no table, broken beds. The old rusty refrigerator was empty and had no food. The children were hungry and suffering from malnutrition. Henni also suffered from health issues due to lack of nourishing food, which was only a small symbol of her difficult physical and mental state.This visit to Henni’s house was a turning point for the family and for our staff. Right away we realised Henni is someone very special. From that point on, the family received ongoing support of food packs and financial vouchers, furniture, a new refrigerator, school bags for the kids, clothes, and heaters. All of these provisions helped her realize that her prayers had been answered. As our team just loved on Henni, we saw how she never expected anything and always wanted to give something in return. She literally had nothing, and yet the little she had she wanted to give to us so we could bless others in need. On one occasion, she handed us a bag of brand new clothes she was given by another charity organization. She said, “I don't need these nice clothes. Please give it to a needy family”.Henni’s life was transformed. We saw through the years how she became a happier person, started taking care of herself, and was looking healthier. Her children were also improving socially and doing so much better in school. With a grateful heart, Henni sends us messages of blessings and thanks. She never misses an opportunity to phone our office simply to bless our work and our team. Every holiday and every few months, she calls us to simply say, “Hope you all are well. Just calling to let you know you are in my thoughts and prayers”. We love to just be there for others and to see the real change in those we embraced throughout the years. There are thousands of young people who are searching for an ear to hear, an eye to see, and a heart to care. The sincere words of thanks and blessings reflect to us how essential the help is to the recipients. God opened the doors for you and us to be a blessing, and we consider this as an amazing opportunity and a privilege.We invite you to partner with us as God uses us to make a huge impact on the precious lives here in Israel.\n\n“I am sure of this very thing—that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the Day of Messiah Yeshua.” — Philippians 1:6\n\n*Name has been changed.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

This visit came in the wake of the tragic events of October 7th, and I feel a deep connection to these teams, who faced unimaginable hardship yet persisted, guarding their communities with remarkable courage.The tragic day took nine of these dedicated security personnel from us, leaving an indelible scar on the Eshkol region. However, their successors continue their legacy, standing as beacons of resilience to protect the lives of those in the settlements. It is thanks to your unwavering support and generosity that Vision for Israel was able to provide a donation of equipment valued at NIS 500,000, including defibrillators, radios, and scanning lights for 32 squads.The event in Eshkol was moving, filled with both sorrow and resolve. As we spoke with the security officers and local leaders, their words resonated with a heavy sense of grief. The massacre of October 7th left a lasting scar, but their spirits are not broken. Their determination to safeguard their communities remains strong, fueled by love for their homes and families.I felt compelled to share a message of faith and unity, reminding them of the support from Christians worldwide. I said, \"We have many friends around the world who love us and know that the nation of Israel is alive, they are many and dear, Christians who love Israel, thanks to whom we can give you the donations today. They would come fight for us here if they could, and they mean what they say.\"I was also reminded of Barry’s dedication over the past two and a half years, installing shelters across the South, including 155 shelters around the Gaza Envelope. This project, fueled by your donations, has saved hundreds of lives, shielding families from rocket fire and other attacks.Your generosity makes a profound difference, supporting not only emergency response teams but the entire Eshkol region. Together, we are rebuilding and restoring the communities, offering hope and resilience in the face of adversity.As we left, I felt a renewed sense of hope. The bravery and dedication of the security teams, the support of our partners and donors, and the love of our global community strengthen us all. Together, we will continue to restore and protect the Eshkol region.Thank you for being a part of this journey and for your steadfast support.

It’s so easy to fall into patterns of judgment, hostility, and anger when we see how much pain occurs in our world.With this in mind, it’s helpful to remember that faith in God brings stability. As we begin to prepare for the coming high holidays, we see countless scriptural reminders that God always prevails. Though the world has been through uncertainty before—and certainly will go through it again—God has always walked with His people, and given reassurance through scripture.In times like this, it can be helpful to bring the word of God to our communities, and to those in need. We all need to lean on each other, strengthen one another, and know that where one is weak the other is strong. When we learn to rely on each other and have faith in God together, we can begin to see something good on the horizon.At Vision for Israel, we have been providing humanitarian aid and economic support for the needy, the sick, the downtrodden, and victims of terrible brutality for over 27 years. And it is this community—this service we give to one another—and our faith in God that has gotten us all through the worst of times. One of the great mitzvahs is, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Banding together with others to walk in God’s word, and cyclical activity in our organization has saved us from despair on many occasions. From seasonal projects to actions to donations, we create patterns of faith that lift us up on our darkest days. We encourage you to join us on this journey.Though it may feel as though the world is full of instability, mistrust, confusion, and division—remember that every month and every season has meaning in our lives. We may feel confused, and even scared at times, but God has a plan for all of us. As we turn to God, He creates the stability, clarity, and trust that we so desperately seek. By manifesting these traits in our lives, we are making changes in the world around us. Holidays are times of community and care. If you are feeling lost or helpless, we encourage you to turn to the scripture. Reflect on how you can bring God’s word to action in your life, and create stable and faith-based cycles for your days. When we focus on God’s messages of life and love, we can begin to see a brighter tomorrow. We call on all of you; our partners, donors, and friends to stand with us in doing so regularly and consistently. Your loyal heart through ongoing prayer and financial support makes a huge difference in the lives of so many people here in Israel.\n\nWith a grateful heart,\n\nBarry and Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "title": "A Miraculous Milestone: Ya’ir’s Story",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nLast month, our team at Vision for Israel hosted a Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebration for young adults who have suffered from terror attacks. By throwing a party, we allowed them to celebrate this major milestone when they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to. Though they all have touching and tragic stories, one of the Bar Mitzvah boys, Ya’ir, had a story that stood out to us. He gave a speech at the President's house during the celebration. We wanted to share his story with you.Though he is now 13, Ya’ir was injured in Sderot when he was 9. That dayhe went to a protected park in Sderot withhis mother and sisters. Ya'ir played with his friends in one area of the park while his sisters played in another area, and his mother sat with the other mothers. All of a sudden, a Code Red alarm sounded and all the children started running in panic. Because he was so young, Ya'ir didn't know what to do. He searched for his mother and could not find her. He began to cry, running everywhere to try and find her. Because of this, he did not have time to get into the mobile shelter. As he looked skyward, he saw the interceptions and heard the terrifying booms of the attack.Although Ya’ir didn't suffer any physical harm, he was mentally injured. Any loud noise, like a plane in the sky or a motorcycle passing by, causes a stress reaction. He can’t shower without the door open, and can’t stay home alone because of his condition. Doctors believe that this is likely a case of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).At first, Ya'ir's mother struggled to identify Ya’ir’s condition. However, after talking with her friends and hearing that their children suffered similar conditions after rocket attacks, she decided to get help for her son.There were times before Ya'ir was injured that his mother went for a walk with the children where there wasn't a protected area. During these walks, if a Code Red siren sounded, Ya’ir’s mother would lay her children on the ground and lie down on top of them. Ya’ir will no longer go for these walks. His sisters are similarly hesitant, though they aren’t as traumatized as Ya’ir is. Not being able to find one’s mother in a time of crisis is truly traumatic.Though Ya’ir’s story touched our hearts, it is unfortunately not the only such story we’ve heard. Thousands of children are terrorized every day by the violence and terror that surrounds Israel. Childhood wonder and freedom are being stripped away, as these children see how brutal and terrifying the world can be. Many of them are forced to grow up faster than they should.Our mission at Vision for Israel is to protect as many of these children as possible. We have been providing mobile bomb shelters so that more people have access to protection. We offer food and financial support to families who have experienced terrorism. We even host Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations annually to ensure that these children have some happiness in their young lives.All of the work that we do is made possible by you, our friends and sponsors. Without your regular donations and generous gifts, children like Ya’ir would define their lives only by violence, terrorism, and pain. Because of you, they can receive a bit of happiness and comfort despite what has happened to them.As we enter 2022, please consider beginning or increasing your donation to Vision for Israel. It is because of our donors that we can support so many in need. If you wish to make a donation, you may do so here. We also accept Crypto, bank transfers, and many other alternative ways to donate. May we be able to continue our work into this new year, and may the Lord bless and keep you.Your friends,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,On March 26, 2021, NASA announced that the earth is completely safe from any potential calamity-causing asteroid for the next 100 years. The 100 foot long 9943 Apophis asteroid will fly by the earth on April 13, 2029. It will be within 20,000 miles above the surface of the earth and we will all be able to see it visibly without binoculars and telescopes. This should allay us of any fears of an asteroid striking the earth and ending life as we know it.\n\nHowever, a far greater calamity faces us on earth in the not-so-distant future—the next war in the Middle East. This next war or coming wars, will not be like anything we’ve seen before, and it’s been weighing heavily on my heart.For the last several years, Iran has been in fast-forward motion to obtain nuclear weapons. News agencies have under-reported this, and have minimized the significance of the shadow wars that have been taking place between Israel and Iran behind the scenes.\n\nNevertheless, despite all of these events, the pieces of the biblical prophetic puzzle are fitting into place quickly for a soon coming war. I dare not predict dates and rarely has anyone ever prophesied a war ahead of time as it certainly comes upon us when we least expect it. The facts on the ground are just a few items of what will take place. The next war against us will be a multi-front attack from potentially the following: Iran, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria, the Houthis in Yemen, pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, Hamas and Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip—and add to that the unknown possibilities of Turkey and Russia’s involvement.\n\nThis war will be devastating in many respects since Israel’s present enemies claim to have an arsenal of around 150,000 missiles, both short and long-range, not to mention the new generation of drones used in warfare. It is reported by Israel’s generals that between 1,000 to 2,000 missiles will be launched against Israel daily. Add to this the growing alliance between President Putin in Russia, Turkey’s President Erdogan, and Iran’s Jihadist leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and it looks more and more like the formation of nations mentioned in Ezekiel 38; the war of Gog and Magog.\n\nIn the last few years, Israel has flown over 1,000 sorties to bomb missile-producing factories in Syria and Iraq financed and instigated by Iran—not to mention other areas unknown to us over the last 10 years. Whether from Israel or a combination of nations involved, cyber warfare has been going on back and forth between Iran, Israel, and the West. The mantra from Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the IDF, and other western and Middle Eastern nations whom Iran is against has been, “We will not allow Iran to achieve nuclear weaponry.” Something is bound to happen.\n\nDuring this coming summer, Israel will be preparing again for war—as it has been doing in the north of Israel for the last couple of years due to rising tensions on the Syrian and Lebanese border. The IDF will have a month-long large-scale exercise take place inside and outside of Israel’s borders. It is said to be the largest military exercise ever and will stretch the capabilities of Israel’s special forces, the Air Force, the Navy, and both regular and reserve soldiers. As mentioned in the Israeli press, the month-long exercise will include a multiple-front battle scenario where the north, south, Judea, and Samaria are all in play—a worst-case scenario for the IDF. This conflict will place civilians as the target. They will be in the frontlines. Our plan to use all resources to help save lives, and to support and embrace survivors in times of great need.\n\nAt Vision for Israel, we can participate in Israel’s defense in this hour of great need. As we have said many times before, “When a crisis comes, it's too late to prepare.” We must take a holistic approach to increase our awareness and preparedness. Our small fleet of donated ambulances and medi-cycles for first responders and medical personnel has already responded to over 27,000 emergency calls—most of them tending to wounded persons, both Jewish and Arab.\n\nVision for Israel also continues to purchase medical beds for critical care units in hospitals, medical emergency kits for doctors in the field, and a state-of-the-art blood bank vehicle that is currently being built in the US, to be shipped to Israel.\n\nWe are assisting those suffering from various types of PTSD, and children and single mothers who have suffered from domestic violence—not to mention the high rate of unemployment because of Covid-19. I finally understand the words of Yeshua when he said, “The poor will be with you always.”\n\nNOW is the time to prepare! Now is the time to build up the necessary resources! Now is the time to order and purchase! Now is the time to get people back on their feet after the multiple lockdowns and thousands of deaths because of the pandemic. As the Israel Defense Forces are preparing, so too Vision for Israel is making a clarion call to all of you; Let us prepare and build up the arsenal for giving in a time of need. In this, they will see our love to provide an avenue of hope and deliverance from the Lord Himself.\n\nAll donations will be going to help save lives and restore the spiritual and physical needs of the people in Israel.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nWoman's day is the perfect opportunity to shine the limelight on the world's brave, strong, and loving women. Unfortunately, many people, living normal lives find themselves stricken by a sudden and unexpected terror that forever changes their lives.The journey to recovery is long and arduous, and many times the victims are left without defense or support.We at Vision for Israel have not forgotten such women.In honor of Women's Day, we were privileged to sponsor 200 women, members of the Organization of Victims of Hostilities, for an empowering day of pampering dedicated solely to them.Upon arrival, the women enjoyed a wide variety of light refreshments, and then, without further ado, the pampering began!The women sat back and relaxed as professional make-up artists, hair stylists, and pedicurists made them feel brand new. Then they allowed their bodies some much-needed rest as we spoiled them some more with relaxing massage treatments.For many, it takes months to make the time for one hair appointment, let alone all the pampering treatments Vision for Israel was honored to provide. After being greeted by Barry and representatives from the Organization of Victims of Hostilities, Shira Isakov took center stage as she shared her heroic story of survival.Shira's ex-husband violently attacked her in an attempt to murder her right in front of their young son. Although Shira was severely injured, she miraculously survived to tell her story.Understandably, many women affected by domestic violence never share their stories of survival, but Shira mustered up the courage and publicized her case. Since then, she has become a strong symbol and inspiring role model in the fight to prevent violence against women.As a public figure, she uses her influence to work with women affected by violence and continues to encourage many to leave abusive situations and seek help.The women then enjoyed a rich meal together, and to top it off, all laughed to their heart's content as they watched a live comedy show by the talented comedian Tzipi Shavit. The memories that often plague survivors of terror can leave them weary, afraid and lonely, but the comedy show provided pockets of joy and liberation from the burdens they carry.At the end of the self-care day, each woman received a special surprise from us -- a gift basket packed with skin care creams.Following the self-care day, the Organization of Victims of Hostilities received heartwarming responses from the women.They wrote to us, saying: “The event was successful and impressive. The women of the organization waited through the COVID period for such an event. Especially these days, when a wave of terror strikes us again, such an event is extremely vital.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,In the heart of our Passover preparations, as we reflect on the themes of deliverance and provision, we share with you the poignant story of Shalom, whose resilience and hope amidst the trials our community faces stands as a testimony of God’s faithfulness.Shalom, a resident of Sderot, has been a part of our Vision for Israel family since 2015. His life took a tragic turn in 2004 when he was gravely injured in a rocket attack. Despite the challenges, Shalom and his wife, Bruria, have navigated their journey with grace. VFI has supported Shalom and his wife in providing essential aid, such as eyeglasses, a new laptop, and financial aid. The recent conflict has cast a shadow over their lives once again. On October 7th, the tranquility of their Sabbath morning was shattered by a red alert, heralding a barrage of attacks on Sderot. The terror struck close to home as despicable acts of violence unfolded in their neighborhood, leading to the tragic loss of lives and leaving Shalom injured.The couple's harrowing experience of seeking refuge in their Mamad (safety room) for hours, until rescued by the Israel Defense Forces, speaks volumes of their courage in the face of unimaginable fear. Their subsequent evacuation, amidst the chaos, left them without their personal belongings, even as Shalom's laptop fell and broke. They are now relying on the support provided by VFI and the local authorities while they're temporarily staying at a hotel by the Dead Sea.Shalom's account sheds light on the depth of their suffering—sleepless nights haunted by nightmares, a constant state of anxiety, and overwhelming sadness. Yet, amidst this turmoil, Shalom's spirit, embodied in his poetic letters of gratitude to VFI, resonates with a profound sense of hope and thankfulness for the assistance they have received.This Passover, as we remember the miracles of old, let us also be the miracle in someone's life today. Shalom and Bruria's story is but one among many, a stark reminder of the urgent need for compassion and action. By supporting Vision for Israel, you help provide not just physical nourishment but also a sense of dignity and hope to those like Shalom and his wife, enduring the aftermath of conflict.In this season of deliverance, let your generosity be the manna for those walking through the desert of despair. Join us in our mission to uplift and support families in Israel, ensuring that this Passover, they too can celebrate with joy and gratitude.This year, we've set a goal to support over 1600 families, providing them with the means to celebrate the holiday and their deliverance with dignity. Among them are the residents of Sderot, a city that has endured immense suffering, especially during the attacks on October 7th. The city's plea to aid 200 families with $110 each has touched our hearts deeply, and we are committed to meeting this request.Please donate HERE and help bring a message of hope and renewal to those in need.\n\nWith heartfelt gratitude,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Partners,As we begin the new year of 2023, we want to take a moment to give praise to the Lord for all He has done in and through Vision for Israel in 2022. Thank you Lord for the love You poured out on each person that was in need, for the finances You provided, for every prayer answered. We are grateful for each person we were able to serve, for our team, and the strength You gave us to continue to be the hands and feet on the ground here in Israel.Vision for Israel was founded twenty-nine years ago to bless and assist needy families and new immigrants. Many of the new Olim (new immigrants) arrived to Israel with no family, no savings, no work and didn’t even speak the language. They were struggling to integrate and build a life here. Barry, himself, was a new immigrant and a lone soldier, so he could relate to the challenges they were all facing. This was in the beginning.And what happened in all the years of our existence? The race to help and support the needy never stopped. Every year we increased the number of people supported, the aid that came out of the organization’s warehouses only increased. Shipments that arrived from abroad and financial donations helped to invest in building lives and seeing the fruit we see today. There is no doubt that the population is growing from all directions, a high birth rate and the continued arrival of immigrants to the land of Israel. Terror attacks and Holocaust survivors who suffer from severe loneliness. are some of our most precious recipients of aid. Vision for Israel’s support is only growing and expanding.Today, we stand in awe of how God has touched the lives of over a million people through VFI. It started from a small old barn-like warehouse to now working out of the Millennium Center, which is an incredible miracle, serving thousands of people each year. Over 50,000 emergency calls have been responded to through the help of the five ambulances, five medicycles, one blood mobile, and two fire and rescue ATV’s donated by all of you. Hundreds of thousands of at risk children have been blessed with educational assistance through our “Pack to School” project. Nearly 100 safety bomb shelters have been installed on the borders of Israel. Thousands of Holocaust victims have been embraced through many VFI social events. Medical and emergency supplies have been provided to many hospital and rehabilitation facilities. Countless lives have been saved and greatly impacted throughout 2022.Millions of shekels have been invested for the poor and needy families here in Israel. Your prayers and support continue to empower us to move forward and accomplish so much with a very small team. Our staff is committed to serve and do all they can to bring comfort and support needed to the people of Israel.\n\nFor I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.’ - Matthew 25:35-36\n\nGod has done some remarkable works through your donations, prayers, and ongoing support. Let’s take a look at some of the faces of these precious people that were greatly impacted by your love and support throughout 2022 in this photo album below: With blessings comes great responsibility and ours is to share with you the joy of giving!\n\n“For the poor will never cease from the land; therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor and your needy, in your land.’” - Deuteronomy 15:11\n\nBless the Lord for He has done great things,\n\nBarry, Batya, and the VFI team\n\nWe invested in the lives of Holocaust Survivors by creating fun events and workshops for them to enjoy throughout the year. Some of the events included musical mornings with dancing and tasty food, and various cultural activities all year round.\n\nPurim party to give joy and comfort to victims of terror attacks. We had nearly 300 participants and their families at the Millennium Center.\n\nWe have adopted families into our organization to help them with ongoing assistance. About 300 families/individuals each month were supported and cared for through vouchers, food basket deliveries, basic household and special request items. In total, nearly 5,000 families received direct aid from VFI throughout the year.\n\nMiraculously, we placed over 90 mobile shelters in several cities, towns, and villages with the support of our dear friends from the nations this year! Thousands of rockets land in Israel. From the moment the alarm sounds until the rocket hits the ground, the citizens only have 15-45 seconds to reach a shelter!\n\n20 of the 50 were provided to keep the shelters open only in times of emergency. We have another 30 locking systems to place.\n\nVFI purchased emergency equipment and medicine for a field hospital located on the border of Ukraine. Doctors and medics from Israel staffed this hospital in Ukraine.\n\nWomen's Day – We hosted a day for women who have experienced trauma or violence. They received a day full of training lectures, workshops, and treats.\n\nWe hosted a special cultural event to gather some of the people that have received aid from VFI. About 500 recipients attended and enjoyed a musical show about Israel together.\n\nThis year hundreds of children entering into the first grade received school supplies and backpacks to start their school year. It brings the total to 285,000 kids from the beginning of this project. Just one smile on a child’s face speaks a thousand words!\n\nWe supported 120 students with grants toward their studies in university. We also helped victims of terror in furthering their studies and/or changing their career.\n\nEmergency and medical equipment were also provided for rescue units in the southern settlements of Israel. In the last years over 50,000 emergency calls have been responded to through the help of the five ambulances, five medicycles, one blood mobile, and two fire and rescue ATV’s donated by all of you.\n\nDuring the high holidays (Passover and Rosh HaShanah), we provided vouchers and food baskets to about 2,000 people including lone soldiers, terror victims, new immigrants, holocaust survivors, and families in need.\n\nWe hosted a Bar/Bat Mitzvah event for terror victims some of whom were orphans; 67 teenage boys and girls enjoyed a day full of surprises, celebrations, learning about the history of Jerusalem, singing, music, lectures, and meals together.\n\nAt Vision for Israel, we are working on rehabilitation through music and the arts.\n\nWe welcome the help of the loving visiting volunteer groups anytime. You are a blessing!\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus during a difficult world crisis, Vision for Israel is finally hosting tour groups again at the Millennium Center!\n\nThis is a letter from President Yitzhak Herzog after the Bar Mitzvah event in 2021 that took place at the official residence for 60 children who were victims of hostilities:Dear Barry and Batya,I was excited to receive your letter and I want to thank you for yourcondolences and care following my mother’s passing away.I was happy to see you and get to know VFI’s activity at the recentBar and Bat Mitzvah event—and even more so, the story that you brought to my attention in the letter touched my heart. Your ability to look with open eyes at the reality; to recruit partners, resources, time, and means to help the underprivileged in general and terror survivors, in particular, is inspiring and enables all of us to have an optimistic outlook on the future of the state of Israel. I wish you both a long life with health and goodness, and may you continue the meaningful work for the entire Israeli society.Your success is the success of us all.Warm wishes,Yitzhak HerzogPresident\n\nOur hope is that your heart is filled with praise to the Lord for the wonderful and remarkable acts He has done in 2022. Let us bring in this new year of 2023 with praises to the Lord. We pray that wherever you are, you will share in the wonderful acts God has done here in the land of Israel. Your prayers are valuable, therefore, we invite you to pray with us about these requests this year:\n\nWe are so grateful for you, dear friend, and we are expectant to hear what God will do in and through your life in this coming year, as well!Blessings,\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH VISION FOR ISRAELDear Friends,Shalom and blessings upon you, our dear partners. Together with our team, we continue to pray for you—to become even more deeply established in the word of God, more confident in faith, and to expand your vision and prosper in all you set your hands to do.This year has brought unprecedented challenges. The entire globe, with billions of people, is fighting a new enemy—an invisible virus. We all seem to be busy fighting this enemy. The world has come to standstill, with lockdowns and airport shutdowns—empty streets, and empty shopping centers. Our lives have taken a complete turn. We are asked to keep social distance, preventing our most foundational expressions of love that have served us for thousands of years—hugging, breaking bread together, enjoying fellowship with one another, seeing our grandparents, and visiting the elderly. The biggest threat to the people we love is the way we have always expressed our love. This verse comes to mind again and again: “And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love”(1 Corinthians 13:13). With this we realize what is at stake here, and that with great challenges, come greater victories. Throughout the long history of God and His people, this has always been the case. For those of us who have remained in faith, the challenges we faced with the pandemic and its effects this year have helped us become stronger—and have renewed and reaffirmed our belief that we can overcome any hardship through our faith in God. Together, we can be the hands and feet of Yeshua to bring hope and healing to the people.We look forward with great expectations for the year 2021.The opportunity we have in front of us with this upcoming year is the perfect time to call upon ourselves to be more united, to do more good works, and to comfort and love more than ever. Because of the gains we have made in our faith throughout the hardship of 2020, we are ready to expand the work—to increase our giving, to care for more people, and to enlarge the place of His dwelling.\n\nWith love and much appreciation,Batya SegalFounders, Vision for Israel\n\nKeeping the elderly warm in the winter\n\nBlessing the southern region children with a play for Tu-Bishvat\n\nBlossoming Flowers for Holocaust Survivors\n\nCelebrating Purim with Victims of Terror\n\nGiving financial aid for Passover under the shadow of COVID\n\nProviding protective masks\n\nDistributing essential aid due to COVID\n\nProviding panic buttons for the needy elderly\n\nVolunteers at the Millennium Center, packing food baskets for families in need\n\nFeeding the homeless in Tel-Aviv\n\nSending essential aid to families in northern Israel\n\nSupporting the Ethiopian community during COVID\n\nOngoing efforts at the Millennium Center — Volunteers packing food baskets for families in need\n\nPack to School distribution beginsJerusalem\n\nSderot\n\nPetach Tikvah\n\nGiving Backpacks to children of the Arab community in Jerusalem\n\nGranting scholarships to victims of terror\n\nProviding financial gift cards to families in need for the High Holidays\n\nScience equipment for a special education school in Jerusalem\n\nDistributing food baskets to the new immigrant community\n\nIncredible volunteers packing food and clothes\n\nClothing for Holocaust survivors\n\nFood baskets for the Ethiopian community\n\nBrand new medi-cycle to ZAKA Emergency Responders\n\nContinued efforts among the Ethiopian community\n\nBlessing children with new shoes for the new year\n\nFeeding the hungry in Bethlehem for Christmas\n\nCelebrating Bar and Bat Mitzvah with children from terror victim families during Hanukkah\n\nSupporting lone soldiers with financial aid for Hanukkah\n\nDear Friends,As we close out the year that was 2020, we notice that the new norm seems to be an increasing amount of deception and delusion spreading across the face of the earth.Pandemics and unstable economies and end-time prophecies seem to indicate the last chapter of world history before the second coming of the Lord.So the question is this: How do we want to make our mark in world history—that is—“His Story”?Where do we want to store up our treasures? Here on earth, or in heaven?For many Christian and Jewish believers, we have acted in a religious behavior pattern of life—but now that things are accelerating, it’s time to show God we mean business. The book of Revelation says that evil will become more evil—but good will also become more good. Looking around at all that has transpired this year, does this ring true to you? The book continues to describe a dividing of the ways—we will need to choose. But the good news is that we have an incredible opportunity in front of us: to begin 2021 with a fresh new start.Batya and I cannot thank you enough for your steadfast support throughout this trying time. We extend to you every blessing of Yeshua, and we look forward to seeing His awesome power at work, through our diligent cooperative efforts and works of faith.\n\nWith love, blessings, and all our best wishes,Barry SegalCo-founder, Vision for Israel\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

As wars rage and radical terrorists aim to harm those who are unlike themselves, the biggest casualties are often people who wanted nothing to do with the violence. Innocent, everyday people have their lives stolen from them over their heritage and religion.This is what is happening in Israel right now. Radical terrorists have been attacking Israel in recent weeks, and two Arab members of the Israeli police were recently killed by these actions. Iranian groups of Hamas and Islamic jihad are looking to bring violence and war to the streets of Israel, and the result has been renewed waves of terrorism throughout the country. Thousands of people are vulnerable and scared for their lives.Many choose to turn away in the face of terrorism. After all, it’s ugly. It doesn’t feel good to acknowledge, much less confront. It’s natural to not want to see the pain, suffering, and devastation of other human beings.However, this is not how Vision for Israel reacts. Our team turns toward the pain, rather than away, to try and help as many victims and survivors of terrorism as we possibly can. Every year we give nearly $400,000 in aid to terror survivors.Recently, for International Women’s Day, we hosted a fun day for terror survivor women. Each holiday we support hundreds of families who have suffered because of terrorism. For Purim, we hosted a special day for the families at the Millennium Center. We provide annual scholarships for students for higher education and educational programs. We aim to do more with every passing year.We are coming to you, our partners and friends, to ask you to turn toward those who suffer from the violence with us. Join us in being a beacon of God’s love and light to people who have seen the very worst of humankind. Rather than shutting down in the face of an impossible situation, let’s spring into action, together.A donation is a wonderful way to begin, and you may make one here.We thank you with all of our hearts for your support during this time.\n\nMay the Lord Bless and Keep You,Barry, Batya, and the VFI Team\n\nMay the Lord Bless and Keep You,Barry, Batya, and the VFI Team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Our recent visit to this courageous community has opened our eyes to the profound need for enhanced security and peace of mind.We were gathered around the table in a small room following the distribution of safety gear for the emergency security team. They expressed gratitude to Vision for Israel’s donors and supporters worldwide, who have been steadfast in their concern and support for nearly two decades. Barry inquired about their efforts to rebuild the city after the tragic loss of lives in the massacre of October 7th. They opened up about their personal family tragedies, with several members recounting stories of loved ones lost during the attack. It was vital for us to get to know them. We sensed there was more for us to learn about their lives and the needs there. With faith, we assured them that VFI would assist them also in the future. It was incredible to witness their faces light up with big smiles, and their humble hearts expressed gratitude repeatedly, saying thank you so many times.Today, we reach out to you with a specific and vital need—a request from the municipal civil police of Sderot for a new vehicle. This vehicle is not just a tool; it's a beacon of safety for a community on the edge. With only two vehicles currently at their disposal, the police force is struggling to keep pace with over 1,000 distress calls each month. Amidst their valiant efforts, the events of October 7 have only deepened the urgency for adequate resources.The requested vehicle, a white Subaru XV 4X4, is ideally suited for urban and unpaved areas, providing a robust solution for the unique challenges faced by Sderot's police. Priced at 167,000 NIS ($45,000), this vehicle stands as a symbol of hope and a practical response to the critical needs of the city.The story of a young boy from Sderot, only seven years old, who speaks of missiles and fears with a heartrending maturity, underscores the immediate need for action. His family's decision to move to Jerusalem for a sense of safety is a poignant reminder of the daily realities facing the residents.We ask you to stand with us, to support the brave men and women who risk their lives every day. Your contribution can equip them with the essential tools to safeguard their community and restore a sense of security to the young and old alike.Let us band together to reinforce the walls of protection around Sderot. Every donation brings us closer to a safer tomorrow.Please, donate here to help us secure a new police vehicle for Sderot. Your generosity can change lives and bring peace to hearts that have seen too much strife.\n\nWith deepest gratitude and Shalom,\n\nBarry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Thanks to your prayers and generous support, 458 shelters have already been placed since November 2021. These shelters have saved lives during both sudden rocket attacks and full-scale war, including:\n\nAnd yet—we are not done.We’ve set a bold goal: to install at least 500 safety shelters by the end of 2025. Each shelter costs $14,000 to build and install. These shelters are not simply steel boxes—they are sanctuaries. They are hope. They are life-saving. And until the day comes when they are no longer needed, we will continue to press forward.Would you prayerfully consider giving today to help us reach this goal?Your support could be the reason a child survives a missile attack.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nMoses was a heroic biblical leader—a diligent, faithful, servant of the Lord. In his last days, God told Moses to go to Mt. Nebo in Moab. There, God showed him the land of Canaan and told him he would die there, never entering the promised land. This story’s arc can feel confusing. Moses was one of God’s greatest followers, yet he was not allowed to live out his life in the land God promised. Though Moses did not enter the promised land, we are here thanks to his leadership. Looking at his life and the example he is to the people of Israel, we understand what God expects from His leaders and followers. The reward is not the focus—it is the leadership and compassion that should drive our actions. This gives us a lot to consider about our own lives. The high holidays have come to a close, and now our lives will transition from celebration to inward reflection. Autumn is a time of year to consider our lives, our actions, and our faith as we prepare for the quiet stillness of winter.It’s no secret that the world is in a place of turmoil. Wars rage in many areas, the Covid-19 pandemic continues to threaten our lives, and many modern “leaders” turn away from those who need help and support. As God’s children, it is important that we do not act this way. Moses was never tired of fulfilling God’s will. In fact, all biblical leaders persevered in God’s name. They all had qualities of humility, obedience, faithfulness, courage, diligence, and compassion.Diligence is a key ingredient in our character. If we want to truly serve the Lord, we can’t do it without diligence.\n\nDiligence comes from endurance. At times we are so diligent with the hope to see the fruit of our work, and at times it takes a great deal of patience to see the fruit of what we set our hands and hearts to do. The purpose of diligence is not the reward, the purpose of diligence is faith in God.\n\nAll of us are called to live a life that has a purpose and meaning, perform the tasks responsibly, and invest everything we have to carry out God’s word. We must be stable, be diligent, and patient.It’s essential to understand that you do not need to be special to follow God’s calling. He calls all of us to lend support to the underprivileged. Just as Moses was chosen to lead God’s people from slavery and suffering, our calling is to spread God’s will on earth.While many of us have remained healthy and productive in the past few years, thousands of others have fallen below the poverty line. Millions of people have been fired from jobs or had their hours reduced, leading to an increased rate of poverty here in Israel and around the world. Those with chronic health problems or illnesses are especially vulnerable.With your help, we have an opportunity to provide mobile shelters throughout Israel, and especially in the southern region, to protect families who have no protection in times of crisis. The mobile shelters are vital for saving lives. With your diligence, this can help us to protect the lives of many. With hope and perseverance, it’s possible to continue and develop, expand, and spread love and kindness without limits.We are preparing to meet hundreds of families in the coming months, encouraging and strengthening them. We are turning toward individuals experiencing hardship rather than turning away. Though it may be easier to pretend that poverty is not our concern, God reminds us that it is. It’s our job to enact His will here on earth and remain diligent about helping and supporting those in need—and to never stop doing good.Now, more than ever, we need support from you. Thankfully, Vision for Israel’s donors have been amazing! So far we have been able to bless hundreds of families with magnetic gift cards for the holidays, and we continue to support families who have encountered especially hard times. Over the summer we donated countless school bags to children and families and recently we donated two more vehicles for MDA (a bloodmobile and MICU).Your ongoing monthly support of whatever amount you can diligently give will save and restore lives. Helping thousands of men, women, and children, each year, for the last 27 years, is a result of great partners who are bringing us to a place of desiring to increase and do more. We hope that you remain diligent and supportive—so you can make an incredible difference, and ensure that God’s love is felt by all. May the Lord bless and keep you.Shalom from Jerusalem,Batya & Barry Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

The answer lies in our commitment to the Torah, and Scripture, and in extending a helping hand to those in need.The last day of Sukkot marks a significant moment: the end of our annual Torah reading cycle. Simchat Torah concludes the Feast of Sukkot and ushers in a new year of Torah study. During this festival, we read the final verses of Deuteronomy and the opening lines from Genesis. This emphasizes the cyclical nature of Torah study, a sentiment we express joyfully through the ritual of hakafot, as we dance around the Torah.This notion of the Torah being written on our hearts unites us, even in times when our opinions diverge or when we face challenges.\n\nThe Torah teaches us the importance of \"loving your neighbor as yourself,\" a guiding principle at Vision for Israel. Since 1994, we've been dedicated to aiding Israelis struggling with poverty. Current statistics reveal that around 2.3 million Israelis, including one million children, live below the poverty line, with nearly a fifth of the population facing food insecurity.To address these needs, Vision for Israel distributes a range of essential supplies on a monthly basis. With your help, we've been able to support nearly 1.9 million people, including Jewish and Arab communities, immigrants, Holocaust survivors, lone soldiers, and survivors of terror.As we approach Vision for Israel’s 30th anniversary, we're grateful to supporters like you. You help us embody the spirit of the verse, “Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.” — Psalm 51:10The joy inherent in biblical holidays often stems from the act of giving, especially to those less fortunate.

A few months ago, while visiting the south to dedicate a vehicle for the city police, we had a touching encounter. After the ceremony, we found ourselves hungry, and the only open spot in what felt like an abandoned town was a small falafel and shawarma shop.We stopped to eat, and Moshe, the owner, recognized us. He told us how his home in Ashkelon had been hit by a missile, injuring him and his son. But he vividly remembered how Vision for Israel had helped his family and how we had gifted his son a laptop at a Bar Mitzvah event three years ago. Moshe’s gratitude was palpable. He told us how that laptop had been a lifeline during his son’s rehabilitation and education.These spontaneous meetings remind us of the deep impact your generosity makes on countless lives. Even amidst sorrow and suffering, joy can flourish.On October 7, 2023, a day meant for joy, everything changed. The massacre on Simchat Torah — the most horrific attack since the Holocaust—turned a day of celebration into a day of mourning. Simchat Torah is meant to be filled with dancing, rejoicing, and the completion of the Torah reading, but this year, it became a symbol of unimaginable pain.How can we find joy in a day marred by such tragedy?Yet, we know that joy, kindness, and love must triumph over fear and hatred. Though the massacre will remain in our hearts forever, we refuse to live in its shadow. We honor the heroes who fought bravely, and we stand in support of the victims and those still held captive, praying for their safety and return.Even in moments of deep heartbreak, we choose joy. We believe in the power of love and life. We emerge stronger from sorrow, seeking comfort and salvation through prayer. As it is written:\n\n\"Let God arise, let His enemies be scattered; Let those also who hate Him flee before Him… But let the righteous be glad; Let them rejoice before God; Yes, let them rejoice exceedingly.\" – Psalm 68:1-3\n\nTo our dear friends and partners who continually pray for the peace of Israel, you play a vital role in bringing comfort and strength. Now, more than ever, we need your prayers and support as we work together to restore the physical and spiritual heart of Israel.Your donation makes an immediate difference in helping us continue this important work with terror survivors. Please consider joining us in bringing hope, healing, and joy to those who need it most. Donate here and dedicate your donation to Aid to the Poor. Together, we can rebuild, restore, and turn mourning into dancing.Thank you for your valuable support, blessing the brokenhearted, and comforting many survivors in this time of war and terror in Israel.Chag Same’ach,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

The poverty rate continues to rise, and many families—especially those affected by the tragic events of October 7—are struggling to survive. These are families who have lost homes, livelihoods, and even loved ones. Beyond financial hardship, they are battling emotional and mental distress, trying to rebuild their lives in the face of overwhelming obstacles.At Vision for Israel, we are doing everything we can to bring relief. Our team is preparing one of our largest Passover distributions — providing magnetic gift cards to about 1,200 families. These cards, ranging from $70 to $125 depending on family size, will allow them to buy food and essentials for the holiday. But we cannot do this without you.Take Aliza*, for example—a mother of six who is carrying the weight of her family alone. Her husband, an immigrant from India, is unable to work and takes little part in the household. On top of raising her children, Aliza is also the primary caregiver for her elderly father, who suffers from dementia and requires constant care. Their home is in severe disrepair—broken beds, cracked windows, barely any storage, and children sleeping on mattresses on the floor. The situation is so dire that even social workers, who have seen many cases of hardship, were left speechless.For families like Aliza’s, every penny goes toward surviving another day. They desperately need support, and we must answer their call.With Passover approaching, this is a time to extend our hands in love and generosity. Will you help provide for families in need? Your gift will allow them to celebrate with dignity, knowing they are not forgotten.Your donation of:\n\nPlease join us in bringing hope to Israel’s most vulnerable.

In partnership with an organization that cares for children at risk, the Warm House project is a feeding program that we are launching. This is also our year-end giving kickoff, and it couldn’t be more timely.The Warm House model has quietly served children for three decades across Israel, adapting to changing needs while keeping one constant: dedicated, sensitive, and warm care. Together, we are beginning by sponsoring one Warm House in central Israel that will serve 15 precious children, ages 3–6.Many of these children come from homes marked by violence and chronic nutritional deficiency. That’s why the Warm House provides more than food, where each child receives three nourishing meals a day. The program also builds resilience through value-based education, healthy communication, and language development. Children learn to live without violence, to care for their bodies, to practice personal and environmental hygiene, and to grow vital life skills and social confidence.Each Warm House operates Sunday–Thursday from 1:30 PM to 6:00 PM, and on holidays from morning hours. A seasoned team, including a leading teacher, a devoted “house mother,” and a social worker, cares for up to 20 children per home, offering unconditional warmth, attentive listening, and tailored enrichment led by professional instructors. It’s multicultural by design, serving disadvantaged families from every sector of Israeli society according to socio-economic need.When a child is fed, seen, and loved, everything can change. The Warm House has a long record of children becoming adults who succeed with dignity. That is the future we want to multiply.Here is the practical need: it costs 80,000 ILS (about $24,500) to operate one Warm House for a full year. That includes purchasing food, preparing the meals in the home’s kitchen, and paying the house mother for her work. By God’s grace and your partnership, we intend to fully sponsor this first home—and, in time, more.As we enter the season of light, would you help us set a table of hope? Your year-end gift will nourish bodies and shape futures, turning hunger into health and fear into confidence. Every gift moves us closer to fully funding this home for the year.Please make your year-end gift today so that 15 little ones can eat, learn, and heal in a truly warm home.With gratitude and love,Barry & Batya\n\nP.S.Kick off year-end giving to feed 15 Israeli children.

And one precious life that we recently had the honor to know and bless is Ruth.In August 2023, the VFI team went to Rishon Lezion to distribute gift cards to families in need. Among these people, we discovered one very grateful woman who caught our attention, and her name is Ruth*. As she arrived at the distribution center and was informed that she was going to receive a gift card, a smile lit up her face. She was so happy and wanted to give thanks to VFI for the support.That day we learned more about Ruth and her story. This precious woman lives all alone and is suffering from health issues caused by a hereditary genetic disease. As a result of the disease, her brother died at the age of 57, and her sister is currently in a very serious condition. This is a disease that has damaged the genome of her entire family. This chronic disease makes it difficult for Ruth to function on a daily basis, so she has not been able to work for several years. She was undergoing rehabilitation, however, since the start of the COVID pandemic, she stopped receiving alternative treatments and special injections from abroad. And now, she is not able to afford these treatments to help her condition.She really wants to recover and return to the workforce, but until then, she struggles through the pain of her disease and uses welfare to buy the special food that she has to eat. Even though Ruth has a very difficult life, she chooses to give thanks for the little things. After Ruth shared with us about the challenges in her life, she continued with a grateful heart and said, “The gift card is very significant and useful because I cannot eat certain foods due to my medical condition. I really appreciate the donation from Vision for Israel, which is very helpful for the holiday.” God impacted Ruth’s life through your support to VFI with a simple gift card, and yet, God also impacted us through her with the way she expressed thankfulness in the midst of her suffering. So, as we pray for healing for Ruth and pray for the many others who are in need, let us remember to give thanks to the Lord even in the midst of our suffering.\n\nThere are so many others who are poor and in need here in Israel.

This holiday celebrates the cycles of life and the beauty of new beginnings. Yet, as we reflect on this season of hope, we must also remember the pain and trauma faced by so many families in Israel following the recent war in Gaza and the hostage crisis.The recent ceasefire agreement brought about the release of ten hostages, reuniting families after over a year of unbearable separation. Among them was Gadi Moses, who was held captive for 482 days—a harrowing ordeal that finally ended in his long-awaited return. While we thank God for these answered prayers, some hostages remain in Gaza, and their loved ones continue to wait in anguish for their return.For those who have been freed, the physical and emotional scars are deep. Survivors of captivity face unimaginable trauma, and their families must now navigate the long road of healing together. The need for support—both practical and emotional—has never been greater.One story is of Sahar Calderon, a 17-year-old girl who spent 54 days in Hamas captivity alongside her younger brother, Erez. Although she is now back home, her father, Ofer, remains a hostage. Sahar describes her ongoing struggle:\"On the outside, I can look radiant and happy. On the inside, I’m broken. Every day when I wake up, I’m back in Gaza. It scares me to go out. I’m afraid of every stranger I see.\"Sahar’s words speak not only to her own pain but to the collective trauma of so many families whose lives have been shattered by these events.The Katz-Nathanson family is one of many still waiting for answers. Doron Katz Asher, a young mother, was kidnapped along with her daughters Raz (4.5) and Aviv (2.5). Her mother, Efrat, and partner, Gadi Moses, were also taken, along with her brother Ravid.While Gadi Moses has now been released, Doron and her daughters were previously featured in a Hamas propaganda video, and the whereabouts of other family members remain unclear. For their sister Lior, the uncertainty is agonizing:\"Our house in Nir Oz is still standing, but we have no family to return to. A quarter of our community is gone—kidnapped, missing, or dead. We don’t care about the house. We just want our family back.\"These stories remind us of the fragility of life and the strength of the human spirit. They also remind us of our shared responsibility to care for those in need.Tu Bishvat reminds us that after the darkest of winters, life begins to blossom anew. Just as trees take root and bloom, so too can hope grow even in the harshest conditions. But this process requires nurturing. It requires us to plant seeds of healing, restoration, and support.Vision for Israel is on the front lines, providing assistance to terror survivors, their families, and the broader community.

The arrival of Elul signals the end of summer, where one sees the first signs of autumn clouds in the sky. This is the 12th and final month of the Hebrew calendar.The month of Elul is a time of self-observation and preparation for the new year. Jewish tradition directs us to self-examination at this time of year, to understand what we want to change, and create a new reality in our lives.This is a time when every person should reflect on what’s in their heart. In doing this, we can review our actions over the past year, pay attention to our mistakes, and draw conclusions concerning the future. This internal critique is called \"Illul\" in Aramaic (therefore the name Elul).In Hebrew, the acronym for Elul (אלול) is Ani l'dodi vedodi li, or, \"I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine\" (Song of Songs 6:3). This verse from the Song of Songs has a flow of something eternal. \"I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine\"—it goes on because it has no end.Each person who believes in the Scriptures and lives a life of faith knows that a life full of spiritual abundance requires constant contemplation. On a daily basis, we all are searching deeper into our souls, not just once a year.\n\nBut even if we do this every day of the year, Elul is a good time to stop and see how we can improve our relationship with God, with our friends, and those around us.At Vision for Israel, we take this special time to examine ourselves and ask how we can improve and expand what we started doing 27 years ago. It has been because of you, our faithful and trustworthy friends, that we’ve been able to bless so many. Emergency and disaster relief; aid for the poor and needy, Holocaust survivors, victims of terror and their families; and help for all those in the land who are suffering—this is the work the Lord has called us to do, and we are eternally grateful for the blessings and partnership you have entrusted us with along the way.As you consider your support to Vision for Israel, this month is a wonderful time to begin your monthly giving. Each of you gives us the strength, in prayers and support, to help us increase and expand our activities. Just as there are cycles in the year, we urge you to support Vision for Israel regularly, with any monthly amount you can afford. With options for one-time or monthly gifts, you can provide a basis of support to sustain our far-reaching ministry—and make an indelible mark on the world, in whichever way God has called you to.Our dear partners, we at Vision for Israel are lifting you all in our prayers, especially at this time, that the Lord will keep you, protect and preserve you, give you good health, and bless you with all blessings from above.\n\nMay the Lord bless and keep you.In His Service,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,With global anti-Semitism coming on like a tsunami, with increasingly bigger waves, we are on the precipice of seeing the greatest return of the Jewish people to their homeland. It seems that threats are coming at our people from every side, and naturally many people want to return to their roots. However, Israel has seen its own share of perilous times recently. Over 4,000 rockets and missiles were launched against the Israeli people as of May 10th, 2021. This violence came from the terror groups of Hamas and Islamic Jihad, both funded by Iran. Innocent people and children in Israel, of all ethnic and religious backgrounds, have been targeted as they take shelter and refuge wherever they can. As always, God’s word is here to guide us. In Psalm 91:5, He says, “You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flies by day…” Though we may be going through tough times, God’s word provides a balm to our souls. The greatest supporter of global terrorism and the threat to Israel’s existence is Iran. As you have likely heard, Iran has enriched its weapons-grade uranium to over 60%. Once it is enriched to 90% they will be able to produce nuclear bombs to be placed on guided warheads. They are reaching this goal fast, and refuse to engage in productive negotiations. Israel is quickly and steadily running out of time. A spokesman for Iran’s army issued a statement saying: “The destruction of the occupation regime in Jerusalem is the greatest goal before us and the greatest goal we are striving for. We will not back down from this ideal by one millimeter, even if we are torn to pieces.” And he added: “The fake Zionist regime must disappear and it will surely disappear.”Human lives and souls are at stake. Eternity is approaching and everything we do now to save His people is important. God’s word gives us many promises. He says that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel, and the Jewish people will return to the land of their forefathers in the end times. One day soon, which we all hope for, Yeshua, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, is going to take up His throne in Jerusalem and we will all witness the greatest outpouring of God’s Spirit and glory falling upon the Jewish people. His Word promises a national deliverance and salvation. We are to be like the midwives who aid in giving birth to His plans and purposes.\n\nThough over 22,000 missiles launched against Israel in the last 15 years, we as believers need to take action. Here at VFI, we partner and provide secure shelters for the people of Israel. We are taking up God’s cause for His people now and until the end of time. You can join in this mission. As this year draws to an end, your donations, of any amount, provide us with the support we need to protect God’s people from peril. If we are going to fight the darkness and despair of Iran’s terrorism, we must build our strongholds, and provide security for our families, neighbors, and communities. Your donations help us provide bomb shelters that can save hundreds of Jewish lives. With the help of the Holy Spirit, we can become proactive rather than apathetic or passive. Let us not cower in fear, but step forward into His light and act in His name.\n\nShalom from Jerusalem,Barry and Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

As you have likely heard, Iran has enriched its weapons-grade uranium to over 60%. Once it is enriched to 90% they will be able to produce nuclear bombs to be placed on guided warheads. They are reaching this goal fast, and refuse to engage in productive negotiations. Israel is quickly and steadily running out of time. <br/><br/>A spokesman for Iran’s army issued a statement saying: “The destruction of the occupation regime in Jerusalem is the greatest goal before us and the greatest goal we are striving for. We will not back down from this ideal by one millimeter, even if we are torn to pieces.” And he added: “The fake Zionist regime must disappear and it will surely disappear.”<br/><br/>Human lives and souls are at stake. Eternity is approaching and everything we do now to save His people is important. God’s word gives us many promises. He says that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel, and the Jewish people will return to the land of their forefathers in the end times. One day soon, which we all hope for, Yeshua, King of Kings and Lord of Lords, is going to take up His throne in Jerusalem and we will all witness the greatest outpouring of God’s Spirit and glory falling upon the Jewish people. His Word promises a national deliverance and salvation. We are to be like the midwives who aid in giving birth to His plans and purposes. </p><p>Though over 22,000 missiles launched against Israel in the last 15 years, we as believers need to take action. Here at VFI, we partner and provide secure shelters for the people of Israel. We are taking up God’s cause for His people now and until the end of time. <br/><br/>You can join in this mission.  As this year draws to an end, your donations, of any amount, provide us with the support we need to protect God’s people from peril. If we are going to fight the darkness and despair of Iran’s terrorism, we must build our strongholds, and provide security for our families, neighbors, and communities. Your donations help us provide bomb shelters that can save hundreds of Jewish lives. <br/><br/>With the help of the Holy Spirit, we can become proactive rather than apathetic or passive. Let us not cower in fear, but step forward into His light and act in His name.</p><p>Shalom from Jerusalem,<br/><br/>Barry and Batya</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friend,Entering the season of Hanukkah, “The Feast of Lights”, and Christmas, the message we hear is of peace, love, and victory. A message of light fighting against the darkness. We are reminded of the shared values that bind us together, Jews and Christians.During the feast of Hanukkah, many celebrate the victory of the Jews who fought against their enemies and won. Those who are celebrating the birth of Yeshua, the Jewish Messiah who brought salvation and hope to the world, are celebrating the light of the world. On the other hand, we also confront a harsh reality – the rise of global antisemitism, a threat to the very fabric of our shared humanity. The battle against those dark forces who are bringing hate and destruction.The story of Yeshua, born in a humble manger in Bethlehem, resonates deeply with the Jewish experience, embodying the principles of humble beginnings, hope, love, and redemption. Yet, in these times, when hatred against Jewish communities is escalating, we are called to reaffirm our commitment to unity and understanding.Vision for Israel’s work with Holocaust survivors like Leah, born in Romania, brings to light the devastating consequences of unchecked hatred and prejudice. During the war, Leah and her family first hid in their house, living in constant fear. Her father was forcibly taken, and the family had to flee, finding temporary refuge in a stable and later in the basement of a compassionate neighbor. This neighbor, later recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations, provided them with fake IDs and helped them escape to a remote village. Leah vividly recalls the harrowing experiences of hunger, thirst, and the loss of a normal childhood. These early traumas have left a profound mark, and her tears today are a testament to the enduring impact of those dark times.After making Aliyah and settling in Tel Aviv, Leah's life continued to be shadowed by the past. She has faced years of crying, and major depression, and is recognized as having a mental disability due to her experiences. Now a widow, Leah recently suffered a stroke. Despite her physical and emotional challenges, she remains a symbol of resilience. Today, she is accompanied by a social worker and a volunteer who visits weekly, helping to alleviate her loneliness. Vision for Israel has been providing her with ongoing assistance, standing by her side through these later chapters of her life. By standing with Vision for Israel, you contribute to a world where respect and empathy transcend divisions. Your support enables us to extend a helping hand to Holocaust survivors like Leah, offering them the dignity and care they deserve in their twilight years. These heroes, who have witnessed the worst of humanity, now deserve the best we can offer.With your help, we can provide for special expenses like medical and dental care, and essential personal hygiene disposable products that are not included in their medical insurance. Your gift of $100 each month supports one Holocaust survivor by providing them with the care they need in their golden age.\n\nAdditionally, as we reflect on the values of this season, let us also remember the ongoing plight of terror survivors in Israel. Their stories, marked by pain yet defined by courage, remind us that the light of hope must never be extinguished.In this time of giving, your ongoing monthly generosity can bring comfort, joy, and light to those who have suffered the most. Let us unite in the essence of this holiday season to light up the lives of Holocaust and terror survivors, embodying the message of peace and love that Yeshua taught.\n\nAs we celebrate this season, let’s embrace its true heart by standing in solidarity with those facing antisemitism and terror. Together, we can create a ripple of compassion that reaches every corner of the globe.Shining the light with love and joy,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Holiday gift cards, for example, have allowed them to warm their hearts by celebrating with food on the holiday table—just like their peers.\n\nThe commander of the Golani Commando Unit, some of whose soldiers received assistance from Vision for Israel for the holidays this year, sent us a moving Certificate of Appreciation, saying, \"Vision for Israel is] always here for us for any assistance, support, and guidance.\"\n\nHe shared with us a few personal stories from the aid recipients:\n\nAmir* lives in a house for lone soldiers. He was born into an ultra-Orthodox family in Bnei-Brak, and due to his difficulties in studying Torah, he was called the black sheep in the family. At the age of 18, he was forced into an arranged marriage against his will, and about a year later he became a father to a son.\n\nAmir felt no joy in his heart. He felt he was out of place, and decided to divorce his ultra-Orthodox wife and embark on secular life, hoping to find his place in the world. His parents opposed vehemently, were angry, and even severed ties with him. Amir has not been in contact with his parents for about 4 years. He enlisted in the Golani Unit and now dedicates all his time and energy to defending the country. In his few exits from the base, he does his best to see his little son.\n\nBenni* immigrated to Israel from Romania at the age of 14, along with his mother and brother, after his father abandoned the family and severed ties with them. When they arrived in Israel, his mother's mental state was difficult, and she was unable to raise her children on her own.\n\nShe informed Benni that she would no longer support him as a mother, that she was disconnecting from him, and that he had to manage on his own. He moved from house to house and from one boarding school to another, and lived for years without a place that he can call home. Recently Benni and his father renewed communication, but the relationship with his mother is still severed. Benni supports himself entirely, without any help.\n\n*Names have been changed\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nInternational Women's Day celebrates women from all over the world, of all ages and races, for their historical, cultural, and political achievements. It's a day in which the world unites to appreciate and admire the honorable women in their life and an opportunity to strengthen and uplift each other. On the official International Women's Day website, their slogan stands proud:\n\nIn Israel and many other countries, women enjoy the benefits of equality and use their God-given skills and giftings to better the world. But there are also many countries where women's rights are still trampled, and unfortunately, they are seen as 'less than'.What does the Bible say about the worth of a woman? What is God's view of women compared to the world's view?Let's start from the beginning, with the first woman God created - Eve.God created man and placed him in the garden, with all types of greenery and animals to have dominion over. Yet still, the man was alone. God determined that man needed a companion in Genesis 2:20-23:The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man's ribs and closed up the area with flesh. And from the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to him. And the man said:\"This is now bone of my bonesand flesh of my flesh;she shall be called 'woman,'for out of man she was taken.“Throughout time, many have taken scriptures out of context and believe that God created Eve as a slave to be dominated for her disobedience and ruled over as punishment. But those were not God's intentions for Eve's destiny at all; in fact, quite the opposite. Eve was created in the image of God, taken from Adam's rib so that he could have a partner and a companion. Perhaps Matthew Henry, a minister of the 16th-17th century, describes God's intentions for women best when he said:“The woman was made of a rib out of the side of Adam; not made out of his head to rule over him, nor out of his feet to be trampled upon by him, but out of his side to be equal with him, under his arm to be protected, and near his heart to be beloved.”God's loving character always has been and always will be central to the object of His creation - Eve, and every woman after her is no exception. It should be through the lens of His truth that we see ourselves and the women around us. Many would automatically remove Eve from the list of honorable women since she fell into temptation, but God does not 'cancel' a woman for her mistakes. A woman's worth is not based on her achievements or actions; if so, not one woman would be worthy.Instead, her worth is as a cherished daughter of God who shines His character, as Proverbs 31:10 says:\"A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.\"Throughout the bible, God chose many women to be beacons of light in their generation and be an example for their peers - the judge and prophetess Deborah was one of them.We are first introduced to Deborah in the book of Judges, the only recorded female judge, and prophetess in the bible:\"Now Deborah, a prophet, the wife of Lappidoth, was leading Israel at that time. She held court under the Palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her to have their disputes decided.\" - Judges 4:4-5At that time, Israel did not yet request to be ruled over by a king like the rest of the nations, so they relied on judges and prophets to know the will of God. In all of Israel, no one could be found as wise or powerful as Deborah, and the people sought her to hear the will of God.Receiving a word from the Lord, Deborah sent Barak, leader of the Israelite armies, to battle against Sisera, promising that God will give them into his hands. Knowing God's favor was with Deborah, Barak refused to go without her, as he replies in Judged 4:8-10:Barak said to her, \"If you go with me, I will go; but if you don't go with me, I won't go.\"\"Certainly, I will go with you,\" said Deborah. \"But because of the course you are taking, the honor will not be yours, for the Lord will deliver Sisera into the hands of a woman.\" So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh. There Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali, and ten thousand men went up under his command. Deborah also went up with him.\"Deborah's authority was so commanding that even a powerful man such as Barak knew that Deborah accompanying him meant God would be with him as well. God's favor was with Deborah, and He gave the Israelites victory and delivered their enemies into Deborah's hands. Another courageous woman crucial to Israel's victory was Jael, a tent-dwelling woman whose shrewdness sealed their victory.As Barak scattered Sisera and his army, Sisera sought to hide in Jael's tent. She gave him food and drink and covered him with a blanket as he fell asleep exhausted. While he slept, she took matters into her own hands (literally) and ended his life with a tent peg. It took a strong woman to lead an army and another strong woman to end the war. As written in the song of Deborah in Judges chapter 5, Deborah and Jael will go down in history as brave leaders whom God trusted with the destiny of His people. They are not just examples of bravery but, more than anything, an example of favor with God and man.There are many more great examples of strong women in the Bible, some whose history-changing actions are recorded and many who are not.Women have had more opportunities to carry out their God-given talents as the world progresses and have shown great strength in the face of adversity.At Vision for Israel, we meet such women every day. Whether they are single mothers, sacrificing all for their children, survivors of terror attacks, or holocaust survivors - their strength is acknowledged.It takes much to remain strong and base your worth on God's truth in a world full of societal pressure. The world's truth is objective, ever-changing, and sometimes completely unattainable.God's truth is unbiased, never changing, and based on grace and not one's strength or merit.His love and appreciation are not given or taken based on a woman's achievements or accolades, which come and go — neither on her mistakes, past shame, or current struggles.A woman's worth is based entirely on never-changing truth - the Father's eternal love for His daughters.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Our hearts are open to embracing more of those around us and expanding the work of our love and compassion. <br/><br/>Our ears are tuned to this coming year with great expectations for a better year.</p><p>With blessings come great responsibility. As God blessed Abraham with so much wealth, He blessed him knowing Abraham was faithful to stay true and bring many to faith in God. Abraham's responsibility was to witness God’s faithfulness to him and his descendants. The same is with us. When God blesses each one of us, we in return are responsible to share what we have with those who are less fortunate. Bringing a better life to someone else does not diminish our joy, love, or wealth. The opportunity is ours to be a blessing and share it with someone who can appreciate and improve his life as a result.<br/><br/>It’s impossible to see the full impact you have made in other people's lives, but you can see glimpses of the distribution of love through some of the photos we are sharing here with you. It is truly a higher level of giving when one is sending love to someone he has never met or seen. Your giving is the greatest witness. Our team can share with you the amazing testimonies of so many thousands of people who are blessed by your generosity and your heart of giving.<br/><br/>This amazing work that you’ve facilitated, and the many lives you’ve changed and empowered, are beyond our ability to share with you in words. <br/><br/><strong><em>We pray you have a safe and blessed 2022.</em></strong><br/><br/>With grateful hearts, your friends,<br/><br/>Batya and Barry with the VFI team </p><p>Dear Partners,<br/><br/>As the new year begins, it’s the perfect time to reflect on what we’ve done during 2021.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThis is Shalom’s story, one filled with great suffering, and yet he chooses to let thankfulness overflow in his heart in the midst of it all. We have known Shalom and his wife, Bruria, since 2015. We provided them with eyeglasses, and have stayed in touch throughout the years. In 2004, Shalom was injured in a rocket attack and his life has never been the same. Both Shalom and his wife have mental and physical disabilities and are supported by the government and Social Security. Shalom takes anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medication, along with weekly treatments at the Sderot Resilience Center and monthly check-ups at the Sderot Mental Health Center.And if that was not enough to battle with daily, on October 7th Shalom and Bruria were also impacted by the massacre. The terrorists were in their neighborhood that day, and this is what Shalom remembers...“On the holy Sabbath, 07/10/23 at 06:27 in the morning, a red alert was activated in the city... Sderot, where I reside. Heavy barrages of rockets landed continuously. In my neighborhood, despicable terrorists started shooting at my building, and at passers-by and killed some of them...We called the local police station in a panic, but there was no answer. It turns out that terrorists were also there and murdered police officers. So, my wife, Bruria, and I locked ourselves in the Mamad (safety room) for about 10 hours until the IDF arrived.We are now staying at a hotel by the Dead Sea... We receive close mental support. These are hard days, and we can't sleep at night. I rarely leave the room, to avoid meeting people in the elevator. It's thinking endlessly about my friends who were murdered and how it happened that they were murdered.Dear Mrs. Segal, know that it is only thanks to your blessed help as always, you give us, thank God, the strength and the desire to get the most out of life despite all the difficulties.“Shalom and Bruria have been evacuated from their home since October 10, 2023, and are staying at a hotel by the Dead Sea, which the government provides. Shalom and his wife were evacuated under intense pressure, massive rocket fire, and terrorists still hiding in their city. As they were leaving their home, Shalom’s laptop fell and broke. They also couldn’t equip themselves properly before leaving their home.VFI is providing Shalom with a new laptop to replace the one that was broken when he fled for his life. Recently, Shalom also discovered that the water heater in his home was damaged and needed to be replaced. He asked us if we would be able to help him, and we are pleased to help provide the finances for a new water heater and solar panels.Shalom wrote us a beautiful, heartfelt thank you letter when he heard the great news:“To the dear, loving, and compassionate \"mother\" and the founder of Vision for Israel - the honorable and amazing lady Segal Batya... A big thank you for the huge help in paying for both the solar heater and the computer.You give a person like me, who waves his hands in a silent, desperate plea, one of the occupants of the last car on the last train, which has long since left the platform and feels lonely and forlorn, crying out in a voice that no one can hear anymore... You are like the first ray of light from the darkness, appearing in her house as the redeeming angel, and hears and responds to help in every request of the guest.Today I sleep in my room at a hotel on the shores of the Dead Sea and dream dreams of peace and quiet despite the difficulties that stand in my way. They have become softer and more pleasant, and by the grace of the great God, I have the desire and courage to get the most from life because of your warm attitude Batya, and your special employees.“Shalom came to visit us at the Millennium Center to receive the aid that we provided him. Following his visit, Shalom wrote us another beautiful thank-you letter:Unfortunately for all of us, this war, whose end is not yet in sight, continues to hurt many. This situation emphasizes the enormous need for the continued existence of your organization. And your giving is so simple and natural, and it is done in a dignified and noble manner so that it relieves me of even the unpleasantness of being needy.Since I fled in panic, shortly after the massacre was perpetrated by the criminals, when I had to be displaced from the family nest urgently and hastily, my laptop broke, I received a new computer from you, on which I am now pouring out my words for you. How can I cherish you and repay you as you deserve? And if this gesture is not enough, the organization also bears the cost of repairing the solar heater and the malfunctioning solar panels.It's been four months that we, all of us, have been in panic, in turmoil, in darkness. Many of us are in mourning over the murder of loved ones and acquaintances. For four months now we have been subject to nerve-wracking and nail-biting anticipation for the return of the hostages. However, there are also soft and good rays of sunshine, warm and illuminating, shining through the thick black clouds and signaling hope. You, dear ones, are not rays of light - you are a beam of light, with all its colors and shades. For years in general and today - even more so - I have seen and felt it.“Even though Shalom and Bruria have suffered much, they choose to let thankfulness fill their hearts and overflow onto many around them. We are grateful to know them and to be able to serve them in their time of need. Join us in continuing to support many other Israeli’s displaced from their homes, as this war continues on.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nAs conversations continue around the world about the role of systemic racism in policy and policing, a growing number of parallels have emerged between Israel, and its ally to the West—the United States. Both nations boast strong national pride, deep faith traditions, and diverse cultural makeup. They also similarly struggle with issues of inequality, despite the rich diversity they enjoy. Today, we’re examining the situation in Israel, and how some officials are acting to make their home safer, and more equitable for all her citizens.\n\nThe killing of African-American George Floyd while in police custody on May 25, and the massive anti-racism protests that event unleashed—both in the US and around the world—has struck a chord with Israel’s Ethiopian community. “We need the whole system to wake up,” said newly appointed Immigrant Absorption Minister Pnina Tamano-Shata. Tamano-Shata is considered a ground-breaker and a leader in the Ethiopian community in Israel. She is the granddaughter of Kais Shato Maharat, who comes from a long line of prominent spiritual leaders among Ethiopian Jewry, a sixth-generation descendant of Abba Meheri Sutal, a Jewish monk who lived and worked in Ethiopia in the 19th century and served as the spiritual leader for the Beta Israel community. Deputy Public Security Minister Desta “Gadi” Yevarkan, himself an Ethiopian Jew, took to Facebook to condemn the killing of 46-year-old Floyd, calling it “one of the most racist, cruel and deadly events ever recorded” and noting that “police violence against blacks has touched many countries in the world.” Although the Israeli police are tasked with making sure that people feel secure and protected, Yeverkan wrote, often “white Israeli citizens feel safe when they see a police car in their neighborhood, while black Israeli citizens feel unsafe.”\n\nLast year, widespread protests rocked Israel when tens of thousands of Ethiopian Jews took to the streets following the shooting death of 19-year old Solomon Tekah at the hands of an off-duty police officer. Protesters blocked roads, burned tires, and, in one incident, burned a car at Tel Aviv’s busy Azrieli Junction. Tekah’s death came six months after Yehuda Biadga, 24, a mentally ill Ethiopian Israeli, was shot and killed by police who say he charged an officer while brandishing a knife. His death led to demonstrations throughout Tel Aviv. May 2015 saw similar protests erupt following the beating of Ethiopian-Israeli soldier Damas Pakada. Those protests devolved into riots in which police officers fired stun grenades, water cannons, and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who threw rocks and glass bottles at policemen and also vandalized some storefronts. Rivka Demoza, a resident of Haifa, said: “It’s hard for me to see the footage from the United States. It’s hard because I think ‘What if I was there? What if I was visiting?’ I think as a tourist I wouldn’t want to go there. All my friends are sharing posts and talking about the cases from Israel and the US.” Demoza recalled how her younger brother left home one evening to hang out with friends and was confronted by two police officers while waiting for a cab outside their home. The officers refused to believe that he lived there, even after seeing his ID card, she said, adding that if her uncle had not been a police officer himself, her brother could have been in real trouble. “The situation isn’t so different [in the two countries].” said Shula Mola, former chairperson of the Association for Ethiopian Jews, “Violence is violence and racism is racism and when a white person has the power to kill someone black it’s the same, it doesn’t make a difference here or there.”\n\nStatistics show significant inequalities between Ethiopian-Israelis and the rest of the population. Ethiopian soldiers are sent to military-prison at a disproportionately higher rate than other groups and are arrested in civilian life at a higher rate than the general population. In 2017, approximately four percent of Israel Defense Forces soldiers came from the Ethiopian community, yet they accounted for 15.07% of female and 10.78% of male prisoners, according to the Association of Ethiopian Jews. According to a recent report by the government’s Anti-Racism Coordinating Unit, the number of complaints of racial discrimination it receives doubled in 2019, with 37% of such charges coming from the Ethiopian community. The report also noted that while Ethiopian Jews comprise 1.7% of the population, their arrest rate stands at 3.27%. The unit was set up on the recommendation of a commission established by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of the 2015 protests. In February, several police officers were removed from their posts in the southern city of Kiryat Malachi after it emerged that they had mocked and disparaged people of Ethiopian origin in a WhatsApp group, including one young man who had been brought to the police station, bloodied and in handcuffs.\n\n“As a human being and a black woman, I can tell you that a lot of black people around the world and also in Israel can [identify] with what’s happening” in the US, as relating to their own experiences, Tamano-Shata said. She added that she’d told Public Security Minister Amir Ohana he needed to remove problematic officers from the force. “Someone who is racist cannot be in the police. Someone who is a criminal cannot be in the police,” she stated. Things in Israel have improved since 2015 but “unfortunately it’s not enough,” she said. Calling for “affirmative action” and an end to separate classes and programs for Ethiopian students, she said that when people are separated, “they start to believe that they are different and lesser than others.” But while the fight against racism will be a “long struggle” that will only be won with state intervention, many in the Netanyahu administration are sympathetic, she said. “The situation in the US is much worse and the history is different. In Israel, there is a possibility that the political system can fix racism faster, smarter, and more efficiently than in America. We just need the will and leadership.” “I believe in Israel we can make big changes and be an example for the rest of the world.” (TOI / IH / VFI)\n\nSeveral times a week, the Vision for Israel team goes out to distribute hundreds of food bags to needy families in the Jerusalem and Modi'in areas. When preparing food packages, we take into account the needs of the communities we help—so for the Ethiopian community, we include staples they're accustomed to, such as teff, Shiro, rice, and red lentils.During our last trip, we met some very lovely people. Sadly, due to differences in the native language, custom, and other formal differences, their absorption into Israeli society can take years—and make financial survival very difficult. Many within the Ethiopian community are forced to live off a low-income allowance, and severe poverty is common.Ariel, a team member involved in this mission, reported, \"There was an incredibly positive atmosphere, and many people greeted us, wished us a good income, health and that we will always be on the giving end. Due to the heavy weight of the packages—approx. 12kg—the elderly had a hard time carrying them, so we carried the packages for them all the way to their doorstep. We also brought the packages into the homes of people with disabilities of course.\"Thanks to our generous donors and lovely volunteers, hungry people in our community are receiving nourishment for their bodies, and relief for their soul.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Her family consists of her parents, and her four children; ages 22, 19, 15, and 5. When the family arrived in Israel, they first lived in an absorption center, later moving into one of Jerusalem's poor neighborhoods. In 2015 Yatbenash came to the welfare office because of marital problems, and conflict between her husband and their eldest son. The difficulties between father and son affected the whole family and put a strain on their relationship as well. In their relationship roles, her husband was the only one who made decisions, leaving Yatbenash a bystander with no voice. When it escalated to sustained domestic violence, she didn’t know what to do—but after a particularly abusive encounter, she decided she’d had enough and called the police. Yatbenash works hard to provide for the family but is facing many hardships—both financial and emotional. She does everything by herself, without financial or emotional support from family or friends.

Surrounded by harrowing events, and under the constant threat of rocket attacks, they bear on their little shoulders the burdens of their parents—filling their childhood memories with days steeped in sadness and anxiety. If anyone ever deserved a break from the chaos of everyday life—to be transported through fiction to another place for a while, and maybe to have a smile or two—it was these kids.\n\nAnd so, in honor of Tu Bishvat, we at Vision for Israel sponsored a theater play for them. \"An Apartment for Rent,\" is a rich musical adaptation of the famous Israeli book by Le'ah Goldberg. Its story relates to a subject of familiarity—the sometimes-difficult relationships people have with their neighbors and depicts its heroes as finding ways to help each other, finding true friendship along the way.\n\nThe performance took place in the largest protected playroom in Israel, hosting 250 children and their parents for a fun and relaxing evening together. At the end of the event, each child received a grass-head as a gift.\n\nThe Director of the Sderot Development Fund wrote us, saying \"The children of Sderot, most of whom were raised into a difficult reality of security tension and rocket shooting once every few months—are yearning for an activity like this, that can give them a little relief and a sense of normality in the complicated reality that they live in. Thank you to Vision for Israel, and Barry and Batya who head it, and who humbly partner in quite a few initiatives for the welfare of the children of Sderot and its residents.\"\n\nWithout the powerful support that generous donors like you provide, this evening of joy and relaxation for these distressed families could never have been possible.

We all consider what we will leave behind when we’re gone. But in addition to providing for our loved ones, what lasting legacy are we leaving?VFI’s mission to provide humanitarian aid to the people of Israel would not be possible without the contributions of our donors. Many people give to charities during their lifetime, but only around 7% leave a gift to a charity in their will. A small increase in this percentage has the potential to make an enormous impact because planned gifts like these provide vital income to non-profits like Vision for Israel.A legacy gift to VFI costs you nothing today and can be a valuable way of reducing your inheritance tax liability on your estate. This is because a legacy in your will to a registered charity like VFI is tax-free.Beyond the practical advantages, when you leave a legacy gift, you make Vision for Israel, a cause you care about, an important part of your story.\n\n“And I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and your descendants after you.” — Genesis 17:7\n\nWhen you include VFI in your estate plan at any level, your generosity helps us in achieving our mission of supporting and healing communities in need. It may only take a few minutes to leave a gift in your will, but the impact of your donation impacts generations to come.The apostle Paul, author of Hebrews says, “By faith Abel brought God a better offering than Cain did. By faith he was commended as righteous, when God spoke well of his offerings. And by faith Abel still speaks, even though he is dead” (Hebrew 11:4). Over the years, God has placed it on people’s hearts to remember Vision for Israel in their wills—and so, too, do their voices still speak. As you consider your options, we ask that you prayerfully consider leaving a faith legacy to Vision for Israel.

During the break, several people saw our Israeli flag and came to talk to us. They introduced themselves as the organizers of a conference for medical suppliers that happened to be taking place next door to ours.\n\nIn the conversation, we spoke about our humanitarian aid efforts in Israel, and they were so excited to hear that our goal was to help provide medical and emergency supplies to Israel due to the devastating terror attacks that were going on in those days.\n\nAnd so began Vision for Israel’s involvement in the provision of medical supplies. Since that day, we’ve provided millions of Shekels of emergency medical supplies, ambulances, medicycles, and medical equipment that we were able to purchase locally by networking together with Israeli medical teams. It has been an honor for us to be involved with so many life-saving efforts together with each of you.\n\nRecently, we were approached by emergency medical teams and hospitals requesting long lists of medical items that are desperately needed—including ventilators, surgical masks, and even advanced-tech emergency beds for their ICU departments—as we have provided in the past.\n\nAs we read and hear about the number of people dying because of the lack of medical devices, we feel the effects of the outbreak very personally. Some of the worst cases in the US right now are in nursing homes—especially the one in Brooklyn where Barry’s mom is residing. And we’re deeply saddened to report that Barry’s uncle in New Jersey has just lost his battle with the disease.\n\nThe truth is—it’s a daunting challenge that’s ahead of us. Since we began our push to provide emergency medical relief for COVID-19, we’ve been making steady progress toward our $200,000 goal.\n\nAs you know, these are uncertain times for us all. But if you’re in a position that’s financially secure, there are many in Israel who cannot say the same—and your contribution could literally make the difference in real human lives.\n\nWe are your eyes, hands, and feet here in Israel. Together, we form a body that is stronger than the sum of its parts. Your heroic partnership with us has never been more powerful—or more necessary.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nRecently, our team at Vision for Israel held Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations for young adults who have experienced terrorism. Many of these individuals wouldn't be able to celebrate this major milestone without the support of our generous donors. There was a lot of excitement ahead of the celebration. The forecast predicted a storm approaching Israel, and we were all nervous to see if the guests would arrive despite the weather. Thankfully, God had pleasant surprises for us that day.The sky was blue and the sun came out in the morning. It lightly sprinkled later in the day, but that did not interfere with the day's activities. The parents and children were smiling and were so happy to be there--excited for what the day had in store. Some had even been to Vision for Israel's events before, and it was nice to catch up with them. Slowly, the Bar and Bat mitzvah boys and girls arrived with their parents. They had breakfast before going to watch \"Journey to the Past,” and receive a tour of the Western Wall tunnels. At the end of the tour, they experimented with archeological excavations under the tunnels to see if there were any new finds. After this, the boys went up to read the Torah at the Western Wall while the girls sang and heard a lecture at a new archeological facility that opened last month.Every Bar and Bat mitzvah celebration includes a festive meal, so we treated the children and their families to a lavish lunch. Tables were set up in an ancient area inside the Western Wall tunnels. Lunch was served to the guests while the organizers and donors offered congratulations to the children on this special day.The day ended at the President's House where desserts and fruit were served. The President gave warm greetings and a special speech to the girls and boys in a special ceremony. One of the bar mitzvah boys, Ya'ir, gave a speech too. The children were so excited to receive their new iPads and quality backpacks as gifts from Vision for Israel. They thanked us, and their families were so grateful for the special day. We feel so blessed to have been able to do this for them and we thank you, our generous donors, for making this possible. We know that God was looking down on us that day and smiled, as so many young people experienced this blessed ceremony.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Partner,As we approach the special day of August 18, we at Vision for Israel want to pause and reflect upon the life and journey of a remarkable woman whose birthday we are celebrating. Batya embodies unwavering faith, an epitome of enduring love, and a symbol of an unflinching commitment to our community and the land of Israel.Batya's life is not just a tale of survival, but a testament to thriving in the face of adversity. Born and raised in Jerusalem, Batya grew up amidst the company of her four siblings. Her wonderful parents, although they didn't have much, raised her and her siblings lacking nothing. They cared about the children's well-being and raised them to love others. They also taught them what a privilege it is to host guests. At a tender age, she experienced the terror of the Six-Day War in 1967, when two of her brothers were serving in the army and her father was drafted into the reserves. Batya's courageous walk home through the sounds of explosions and gunshots paints a vivid picture of the resilience she carries.Her resilience was put to the test again during the bitter Yom Kippur War in October '73, right before she enlisted in the army herself. Experiencing the loss of her high school friends, she endured the harsh reality of war and pledged her life to a cause greater than herself - serving in the Navy, dealing with the most secret unit in Israel.When Batya was a girl, she loved to read, and subsequently, her first job was storytelling for children on the national radio station. Batya's commitment to serving her country didn't stop there. The inquisitive mind of the Jerusalemite drove her to study and research interesting topics, aiding her journey through life. Her practical approach to life and love for solving daily challenges were reflected in her endeavors in the publishing industry, and later when she brought the joy of music and song composition to life.But the most significant change in Batya's life came in the late seventies when she came to faith in Yeshua. Her life took a dramatic turn when she had a miraculous encounter with the Jewish Messiah. This newfound faith led her to meet Barry at a weekly meeting for songwriters and musicians in Jerusalem in the early eighties. The bond they formed would be the cornerstone of what we know today as Vision for Israel.Vision for Israel was born out of the adversities faced by the people of Israel during the period of the Intifada in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The severe terrorist activities that began with suicide bombers exploding themselves on buses moved Batya and Barry to take action. They desired to bring relief to the severe hardships that existed in Israeli society, leading to the establishment of Vision for Israel in 1994.Batya's legacy doesn't stop at the establishment of this organization. It thrives in the hearts of those we serve. This year, thanks to the generosity of our donors, we have managed to provide magnetic gift cards to 1,500 families in preparation for Rosh Hashana. This marks a 50% increase from our original goal. In these times of social unrest in Israel, the aid we provide to these families is even more crucial. Your generous contributions allow us to uphold Batya's legacy of resilience, faith, and love.Click the button below and join us in continuing Batya's legacy of faith and love.\n\nJoin us in wishing Batya Yom Huledet Same’ach!The Vision for Israel Team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Just as a tree needs water, sun, and nutrients to grow and bear fruit, so too do we need these elements in our spiritual lives and in our walk with God.Tu Bishvat is a time to reflect on the cycle of life and growth and to give thanks for the abundance that we have been blessed with. It is also a time to remember our connection to the land of Israel and the importance of supporting those who are in need.At Vision for Israel, we understand the importance of supporting the disadvantaged and vulnerable population of Israel, particularly during these challenging times. Recent data shows that the poverty rate in Israel has risen, with senior citizens, families, and children being particularly affected.That's why we are appealing to you today to make a donation to our Aid to the Poor fund. Your support will allow us to continue providing financial aid, food, clothes, and basic necessities to those in need, as well as supporting education and other vital programs. With your help, we can make a real difference in the lives of those who are struggling.As we come together to support the weak population of Israel, let us remember that we are all like a tree planted by the waters, rooted in faith and bearing fruit for the glory of Yeshua.

In life, we know blessings as the good that a person desires for himself. But by the biblical definition, blessings are much richer. More specifically, they are the promises God makes to encourage His believers.Carefully wrapped within the essence of the word itself, is God's favor and protection; a gift bestowed by God which brings happiness. A spoken blessing does good to those who hear it, and an action of blessing brings life to those who receive it. Few blessings are more important than shelter for those in need. And when it comes to the dangerous conflicts and rocket fire Israel has received in recent weeks—the need for shelter takes on a special meaning.Mobile bomb shelters serve an important duty in keeping the people of Israel safe from the threat of rocket attacks. When the alarms sound, citizens have the ability to rush into one of the shelters stationed in various public places around the Land and find refuge from a potentially deadly situation.Along the northern and southern borders of the country especially, supplies are depleted and need to be addressed as soon as possible. We are getting desperate requests for the two main public shelter components right now:\n\nThis project is very close to our hearts as our enemies are seeking the destruction and the killing of so many people here. The potential for renewed conflict is getting worse each day—in May, Israel faced a 12-day barrage of over 4,360 rockets shot towards our civilian population.When the rockets were falling on us we found ourselves praying for God’s intervention. Our prayers—and our appeals to you, our faithful partners—have always born good fruit. You have responded positively, and we have now ordered enough shelters and locking systems for the first stage. The goal is to reach many more cities and to do it we’ll need to raise an additional sum of $280,000.

We all have different definitions of success and different starting points, but no matter what the status of each one of us is, we all strive to reach a life of blessing.We all remember the piggy bank we had at home where we would put coins in every time we received a gift from our parents or relatives. Every so often we would open the piggy bank and count the coins. Then we would think about what we could buy with all the coins we saved. Now we are not counting coins we have saved, but blessings. Think of every coin you have received in your life as a blessing you have given to someone in your life. Now is the time to make use of these blessings. It doesn’t matter if you are rich or poor, you can still be full of blessings. Blessings do not come only in the form of economic wealth. Rather, blessings come in the form of joy, health, contentment, love, financial stability, well-being, satisfaction, appreciation, generosity, and gratitude for what we have.The best thing we can do is make our very existence a blessing to others. If you always strive to be kind to those you meet, generous with your resources and help when you can, you create blessings in other peoples’ lives. When you bless others, the blessings will come back to you.This is what VFI is all about. When you partner with us, you become part of the blessing, and in return, God pours His blessings on you.Since the beginning, our goal has been to create a support and blessing system for people who have reached a state of difficulty or crisis. We offer support, funding, resources, and other small blessings for those who need it most: we feed the hungry, we provide for the poor, and we celebrate the lonely and forgotten in our world. In return, we have seen some of the most beautiful and honest acts of love from those around us. We are repeatedly reminded that the Lord's love is so great and His blessings are beyond our expectations or imagination. When we show up and give blessings to others, God shows up to bless us in return. Giving blessings to others does not detract or deprive us of anything. Blessings are not limited, they are limitless and there are enough of them to go around.Each one of you is a blessing.

It's a time to gather with family and friends, to celebrate and remember the Exodus story that stands at the heart of Passover. However, for some families in Israel, financial struggles make it difficult to provide for their loved ones and dim the joy of the holiday.Since 1996, Vision for Israel has been committed to ensuring that every family has the chance to celebrate the holiday with dignity. Each year, we provide gift cards to impoverished families who are struggling, so they can purchase the special Passover food staples they need for this 7-day holiday. Currently, over 1,000 families are hoping and waiting for this holiday assistance.Will you join us in providing for these dear families, so they can celebrate the holiday with dignity?For most observant Jews, preparing for Passover involves purchasing all new food items since eating leavened foods is forbidden. For those in financial distress, purchasing special foods for Passover can pose a big problem. That's where VFI comes in. With your support, we can provide families in need with the means to purchase the food they need for the holiday.Your donations have already helped us provide gift cards to 600 families, but we still have a ways to go before we reach our goal of 1,000 families. Each gift card is for $100 and makes it possible for the family to purchase the food needed for the holiday.Over the past 27 years, VFI has assisted countless families, allowing us to build trusting relationships with social services throughout Israel and support hundreds of thousands of families.Your support can make a big difference in the lives of struggling families. Together, we can ensure that every family celebrates the holiday with joy and dignity.Let's come together to share our blessings with those in need and bring relief to families during this special time.Please DONATE today to help us reach our goal of providing gift cards to 1,000 families. Your generosity can make a real difference in the lives of those who are struggling.May you have a blessed and joyful Passover season.Shalom,Barry & Batya with the VFI Team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Your support has made a significant impact in the lives of the affected communities, and we are delighted to share with you the incredible things that have been accomplished through your partnership with Vision for Israel.Together, we have exceeded our initial goal, raising a total of $59,000! Barry had the opportunity to travel to Turkey and personally deliver your contributions to local believers who operate soup kitchens in the areas hit by the earthquake. Every day, thousands of homeless people come to these soup kitchens for a hot meal, and we feel so blessed to be able to feed the hungry in Yeshua's name.The earthquake in Turkey has caused unimaginable devastation, with more than 50,000 deaths, more than 110,000 injured, and 2.7 million people left homeless. Vision for Israel's involvement has been crucial in supporting rescue operations, providing medical care, and most importantly, nourishing the survivors with daily meals.Your generosity has allowed us to serve approximately 5,000 meals per day, provide clothes for infants, and donate two Living Space Mobile Caravans to assist local teams who have been living in tents. These caravans, equipped with sleeping quarters, laundry facilities, and a small kitchenette, provide a much-needed space for rest and recuperation for the teams working tirelessly to help others in need.Despite the progress we've made, the situation remains desperate. Some areas have recently experienced devastating floods, destroying tents, further complicating relief efforts, and leaving even more people living in rain-soaked tents. We are determined to continue our work under the Medical and Emergency Fund, aiming to reach a new goal of $100,000 to extend our support to those still suffering.We cannot express our gratitude enough for your partnership and commitment to helping the people of Turkey in their time of need. It is in times like these that we remember the words from Acts 11:26: \"Now it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called 'Christianoi'(Christians).\"Please take a moment to watch this video highlighting our efforts in Turkey: https://youtu.be/gqChART2eBAAs we continue to work together, let us remember that our actions truly reflect Yeshua's love and compassion.

This year, instead of gifts, Barry has one special desire: to bring aid to the families who need it most in Israel.Barry's life has been an incredible journey of service and dedication. Born in the vibrant city of Detroit, or Motown as it's affectionately known. Barry experienced close brushes with death as a teenager, and when he was saved in 1971, he held firm to his faith, finding solace and strength in his beliefs.Before making Aliyah in 1981 and marrying the love of his life, Batya, in 1987, Barry pursued a career in radio and TV production. Later, in the early 90s, a profound vision changed his life's course: a vision that Israel would experience a period of abundance followed by great need. This vision led him and Batya to establish Vision for Israel in 1994, where he has been working tirelessly to provide for those in need.From the young Barry working in a pizza place and setting up a film projector on a Great Lakes island to becoming a rock musician as a teenager deep in the music scene; his spirit of service was evident even in his early years. Barry's passion for giving back has only grown stronger over the years. His work with Vision for Israel is a testament to his commitment to helping those in need, and this year, on his birthday, we're inviting you to join us in making his birthday hope come true.In honor of Barry's birthday, we're asking for donations to our Aid to the Poor fund. As summer progresses, we start preparations for the High Holidays by purchasing gift cards for over a thousand families. On average, each family receives about $80. Your donation can make a significant difference in the lives of these families, providing them with essential resources during this special time.So this July, let's celebrate Barry's birthday in the most meaningful way possible: by giving to those who need it most. Your donation to Vision for Israel in lieu of a birthday gift for Barry will help us continue to provide crucial support to families across Israel.Join us in wishing Barry “Yom Huledet Same’ach”! Extend your birthday blessings to Barry by dedicating your donation to Vision for Israel's Aid to the Poor fund today.\n\nPraying you have a blessed and joyous summer (Kayitz Same’ach),The VFI Team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

This year, we are committed to embodying the heart of Passover through our initiative to provide 1,500 families with the necessary resources to celebrate this pivotal holiday.Passover is a celebration of freedom and deliverance, echoed in the famous saying, \"Ha Lachma Anya\" (\"This is the bread of affliction\"), a passage found in the Passover Haggadah and includes the invitation for all who are hungry to come and eat and all who are in want to come to celebrate the Passover. This year, our mission is to extend this invitation far and wide, ensuring that families, including those affected by the heartbreak of October 7, can partake in the Passover feast with dignity and joy.Among those we are privileged to serve is S., a courageous single mother from Ma'ale Adumim. Left to fend for herself and her six children, S. faced the daunting task of navigating life and bureaucracy without the knowledge or resources to do so. Her story is one of resilience; she's taking classes and learning how to handle basic life skills. Through your support, VFI in collaboration with the welfare department, is helping her to slowly rebuild her life and empower her.S.'s gratitude for the support she received from VFI—a food basket and a gift card—reminds us of the profound impact of our collective efforts. Her journey from despair to hope mirrors the Passover story's core message: liberation and renewal.This Passover, we invite you to join us in bringing light to families like S.'s. Your generous donation will provide essential food and supplies to those in need, helping them celebrate Passover with the dignity and joy everyone deserves. Together, we can ensure that \"all who are hungry\" come and eat, and \"all who are in need\" come and celebrate Passover.Please visit our donation page to make your contribution and dedicate your donation to “Aid to the Poor”. Your donation of $67 will provide food for one family for Passover. Our goal is to raise $100,500 to aid 1,500 families this Passover season.As we prepare our homes and hearts for Passover, let us remember the power of community and compassion to change lives.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,As we mark the 30th anniversary of Vision for Israel, we are reminded of the profound impact your support has enabled us to achieve. Over these three decades, with your generous contributions, we have installed 325 bomb shelters across Israel, providing crucial protection and saving countless lives.During the week following our 30th anniversary, we visited the settlements of the north, mere kilometers from the Lebanese border. It’s not always possible for us to meet the recipients of your donations face to face, but when we do, we are deeply moved by their stories and the challenges they face. These individuals, many of whom are true heroes, risk their lives daily in this prolonged conflict.In peaceful times, these northern settlements, enjoy rich social and cultural lives. However, the reality shifted dramatically on October 7th, when they faced new, unimaginable hardships due to the ongoing war and the constant threat of missiles, UAVs, and terrorist infiltration.During our visit, we saw the bomb shelters we donated strategically placed throughout the area. One was near a bus stop, where, just days after its installation, it provided a vital refuge during a red alert siren as children disembarked from their school bus. These children were able to seek shelter and safety until the danger passed, bringing a measure of calm to their anxious parents.These stories of resilience and gratitude reinforce the vital importance of our mission. Your support has placed 325 shelters throughout the country to date. Each alert and siren across Israel underscores the critical need for these shelters.Coinciding with our 30th anniversary, we celebrated the installation of our 300th bomb shelter, a milestone reached since the project began in May 2021 during Operation \"Guardian of the Walls.\" This achievement is a testament to the unwavering commitment of our supporters.On July 22, 2024, we placed another 10 shelters in the north, including three in Majdal Shams. Tragically, just days later, a rocket attack on Majdal Shams claimed the lives of 12 children and young adults. Amid this heartbreaking event, one of our shelters saved nine children, providing them a haven from the blast.As we reflect on our 30-year journey, we recognize the immense value of these shelters. They not only save lives but also provide a sense of security to communities living under constant threat.With your continued support, we can extend this protection to more vulnerable areas. Your prayers and donations are crucial in these efforts. Please consider making a contribution to help us save more lives and offer hope in these trying times.Thank you for standing with us. Your generosity and compassion make a world of difference.Shalom and blessings,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDid you know that God commanded the Israelites to rejoice before him for seven days every single year? Today, the Jewish people still celebrate this holiday called Sukkot, also known as the Feast of Tabernacles or the Feast of Booths, by gathering together with family and friends to rejoice before the Lord!\n\nThis year Sukkot begins sundown on September 20th and ends sundown on September 27th. Let’s discover more about this unique and God-commanded festival by diving into the word of God!\n\n‘So beginning with the fifteenth day of the seventh month, after you have gathered the crops of the land, celebrate the festival to the Lord for seven days; the first day is a day of Sabbath rest, and the eighth day also is a day of Sabbath rest. On the first day you are to take branches from luxuriant trees—from palms, willows and other leafy trees—and rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days.’ (Leviticus 23:39-40)\n\nIn Leviticus, we discover that Sukkot is a time to rest and rejoice in our Heavenly Father, as we remember his faithfulness of delivering the Jewish people out of Egypt, sustaining them for 40 years in the wilderness, and bringing them into their Promised Land! Sukkot starts and ends with a Sabbath, which means no work is allowed on the first and eighth day of the Feast. On the days in between, people are free to work. However, many Israelis take these days as a holiday so they can rest and enjoy time with their family and friends.\n\nSukkot is also viewed from an agricultural perspective and is referred to as the Festival of Ingathering. This holiday signifies the end of the harvest season in the Land of Israel and therefore is a time to rejoice and feast on the crops gathered.\n\n…Celebrate the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in your crops from the field. (Exodus 23:16)\n\nThe word Sukkot is actually the plural form of “sukkah”, which is a booth, tabernacle, or temporary shelter covered with plants. Therefore, the name of the holiday, Sukkot, indicates that this festival has to do with building temporary shelters. It is also believed that farmers dwelt in temporary shelters during the harvest season.\n\nIn the book of Nehemiah, we see that the Lord commanded the Israelites to build temporary shelters to live in during Sukkot.\n\n‘They found written in the Law, which the Lord had commanded through Moses, that the Israelites were to live in temporary shelters during the festival of the seventh month and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, and from myrtles, palms and shade trees, to make temporary shelters”—as it is written. (Nehemiah 8:14-15)\n\nToday, as you walk through the streets of Jerusalem during Sukkot, you will see a temporary dwelling called a sukkah, set up on people’s balconies, outside apartment buildings, and outside of restaurants. Many Jewish people build sukkahs to gather for meals and daily activities for the entire seven-day feast.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Sukkot, Jewish people purchase the four species: willow branches, myrtles, etrogs, and lulav, in the market. The Jewish tradition is to wave the four species each day of the Feast. When constructing the sukkah, it is important to leave holes or space between the branches on the roof so that the sky and the stars are still visible. This is done so the Jewish people can better understand what it felt like for their ancestors who slept under the stars in the wilderness for 40 years. There are still some that actually sleep in their sukkah for an even richer experience.\n\n“Live in temporary shelters for seven days: All native-born Israelites are to live in such shelters so your descendants will know that I had the Israelites live in temporary shelters when I brought them out of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.” (Leviticus 23:42-43)\n\nThis scripture in Leviticus helps us see that God invites us to remember what He did for the Jewish people. Let us take time this Sukkot to remember God’s faithfulness of delivering the Jewish people out of Egypt, sustaining them for 40 years in the wilderness, and bringing them into their Promised Land!\n\nFor us who believe that Yeshua is the Messiah, Sukkot is not only a holiday to remember the past or celebrate the present, but it is also a prophetic feast that fixes our gaze forward to our glorious future. Sukkot is a picture of the day that we will finally get to dwell and tabernacle with the God of Israel!\n\n“And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God.” (Revelation 21:3)\n\nAs you prepare to celebrate this joyous Feast of our Heavenly Father, we pray that you will take time to remember God’s faithfulness, rejoice in God’s goodness, and ready your heart for the incredible future and hope that awaits us in Yeshua!\n\nA Fun Adventure: This Sukkot holiday, try something new! Gather materials with family and friends to build a sukkah together. And then enjoy spending time inside the sukkah with some good food, star gazing, worship, and fun!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

And over that time, despite incredible odds, the people have managed to maintain their identity—even as they assimilated into life within the diaspora.\n\nNo matter who they were—ultra-orthodox to secular from all levels of society, and even many Christians—it has been understood that a return to the land is a birthright that belongs to the people, even before the state of Israel was officially reestablished in 1948.\n\nMany people, including Batya’s parents who were Yemenite Jews, have endured the grueling months-long walk in the desert just to come home to Israel. Many others weren’t as fortunate and died along the way.\n\nBut why do they do it? For what reason would a people undergo such incredible hardship?\n\nFaith, of course. Faith that the days of the Messiah have come—and they want to be there for it.\n\nSince the modern state of Israel was re-established, some 1.8 million people have made Aliyah—originating from all over the world.\n\nWith the vast droves of humanity converging on the land, from all walks of life, it’s easy to see where difficulties can lie. Many of them do not speak Hebrew, as they have lived their entire lives (or even generations) away from Israel.\n\nOther customs and formalities of life in Israel may strike them as hard to understand as well. Differing laws, tax structures, governmental controls, and even societal norms can make a formidable barrier for Jews of the diaspora making Aliyah.\n\nIt’s vital that we help these people find their way home.\n\nThat’s why we’ve been working for decades—together with you, our heroic partners—to provide direct aid to Jews from all over the world who take on the task of making a new home here in Israel.\n\nBarry received a call from a good friend and Bible teacher who invited him to Israel, to make it his home.

He studied Hebrew in Jerusalem, then went on to find a job, and start a business. Later, he married Batya, and established his current vocation of compassion, whereby so many people are blessed.\n\nTogether, we’ve provided aid to thousands of immigrants—from Russia to Ethiopia, and other countries—aimed at giving them a sense of home.

This year it begins on the evening of Sunday, June 1st, 2025. According to Jewish tradition, it is the celebration of the time that God gave Moses the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai. According to the Bible, Shavuot is a time of harvesting the first fruits, counting the Omer, rejoicing before the Lord, and outpouring the Holy Spirit (Ruach HaKodesh). Knowing God’s word helps us discern between biblical commands and cultural traditions. There is value in learning more about the Jewish cultural customs, because we can connect on a deeper level with the Jewish people, understand the culture better, and differentiate between a custom versus a biblical command. Let’s start by looking at the rabbinical Jewish customs practiced during Shavuot.\n\nRuth 2:2-3 - “And Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, ‘Let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes I find favor.‘ Naomi said to her, “Go ahead, my daughter.” So she went out, entered a field and began to glean behind the harvesters. As it turned out, she was working in a field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelek.“\n\nLeviticus 23:22 - “‘When you reap the harvest of your land, do not reap to the very edges of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and for the foreigner residing among you. I am the Lord your God.’”\n\nThere are several other customs and traditions held by different streams of Judaism, but these are the most common. It is important to take notice that many of these customs are not found in the Bible. Now let’s take a look at God’s word to discover how He wants us to celebrate Shavuot.\n\nShavuot is one of three holidays commanded by God to come to Jerusalem and bring an offering to the Lord every year. Let’s open our Bibles to discover more about this God-commanded holiday. The Bible uses several different names for Shavuot, and the first one we will look at is ‘Festival of Weeks.’ The Hebrew word for ‘Shavuot’ means ‘weeks’, and this refers to the counting of the Omer for 49 days.\n\nDeuteronomy 16:9-12: ”Count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain. Then celebrate the Festival of Weeks to the Lord your God by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the Lord your God has given you. And rejoice before the Lord your God at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his Name—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites in your towns, and the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows living among you. Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and follow carefully these decrees.“\n\nIn these verses, God commands the Israelites to count seven weeks (49 days) from the time the grain harvest begins and then to celebrate Shavuot by voluntarily giving an offering to the Lord. And then God commands us to rejoice in Him. What an amazing God we serve that he commands us to REJOICE in Him, as a way to celebrate this holiday! God also commands us to be together with family, friends, and many others as we celebrate. And lastly, he also wants us to remember the time the Israelites were in slavery in Egypt. It is good to remember what we once were... slaves to the Egyptians and slaves to sin. And yet, to also see where God has us now. He set the people of Israel free from Egypt. And he set us all free by the blood of Yeshua, so we are no longer called slaves, but called children of God! Now let’s look at two other names for Shavuot found in the Bible.\n\n“Celebrate the Festival of Harvest with the first fruits of the crops you sow in your field...” — Exodus 23:16a\n\nThe Festival of Harvest and the Festival of First Fruits are two other names for Shavuot. This verse shows us that Shavuot is about harvesting the first fruits. God wants us to celebrate the harvest season and taste some of the fruit he has produced in our lives. This holiday is really about giving thanks to the Lord for the “fruit” he had produces in our lives and His abundant provision.\n\nIn Number 28:26, God says, ”On the day of first fruits, when you present to the Lord an offering of new grain during the Festival of Weeks, hold a sacred assembly and do no regular work.“\n\nHe also commands us to give an offering of the new grain we produced, come together for a special meeting, and refrain from our regular work. So let's make a list from these three scriptures of the ways God desires for us to celebrate Shavuot. God's instructions on how He wants us to celebrate Shavuot:\n\nNow that we have looked at several Old Testament scriptures, let’s zoom in a little more on some verses in the New Testament about Yeshua and the Holy Spirit.\n\nActs 1:3-5 — “After his suffering, he presented himself to them and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive. He appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of God. On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about. For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.”\n\nThe final name for Shavuot found in the Bible is Pentecost, meaning fifty. Pentecost is the 50th day of the counting of the Omer, and Yeshua’s followers were all together in one place when the Holy Spirit was poured out over them. On Shavuot, God gave his people the precious and powerful gift of the Holy Spirit.\n\nActs 2:1-4- “When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. Suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. They saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.”\n\nWe can see that Yeshua’s followers also celebrated Shavuot because they were all together in one place. Can you imagine when the Holy Spirit was poured out and everyone began speaking different languages? Was everyone laughing and just full of God’s joy and peace?\n\n1 Corinthians 15:20-23 — “But Yeshua has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive. But each in turn: Yeshua, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.”\n\nYeshua is the first fruit that was offered back to the Lord for the sins of the world. May we also surrender our lives to the Lord, and bear much fruit for Him here on this earth.\n\nAfter studying God’s word together, we can see the differences between what God wants us to do in celebrating Shavuot versus all of the other additional customs added on by the Rabbis. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with eating dairy on Shavuot or staying up all night reading the Torah and the book of Ruth. But, it’s important to not just accept every Jewish custom, but instead to pray and ask God for wisdom and discernment, even in how to celebrate a biblical holiday.So, as you celebrate Shavuot this year, we encourage you to read the word of God for yourself and ask the Holy Spirit to lead you and your family on how He wants you to celebrate Shavuot. May we all rejoice in the Lord together!From all of us at VFI, we wish you a wonderful and Holy Spirit-filled Shavuot!\n\nRead more about Shavuot in these blogs:The Feast of Shavuot: An Essential Reminder of God’s FaithfulnessShavu'ot—Feast of Weeks (Pentecost)\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Please read with caution if you are more sensitive to these details. The name of the security coordinator has been changed to Oren.It is one thing to hear about the war through the news, but it is another level of impact to hear about it from someone who was actually there on the battlefield. Batya had the opportunity to interview the security coordinator of Shlomit from the Eshkol region near the Gaza border. He shared his story at a special event, where VFI donated supplies to the 32 Eshkol region emergency teams. Now, let’s step onto a kibbutz called Shlomit, on October 7th, 2023 to get a glimpse of what Oren, the security coordinator, experienced that day.“We are used to (the red alerts) here in the area. We go in and out (of the safe room) and continue with life. But (that morning) it wasn't ending, and I, as a Ravshatz (security coordinator), wanted to check what was going on outside my house. As soon as I went out of the Mamad (shelter) I started getting messages (about everything going on). A rocket hit one of our neighbor’s houses, but a second before the rocket hit, they got into the shelter. The house was damaged significantly, (but thankfully) they were okay. The council and our spatial battalion said they saw a few terrorists by Kerem Shalom.“At this point, Oren thought the army would come and handle this situation. However, he was still getting ready in case the IDF soldiers needed backup. He updated his emergency squad with the messages he was receiving and told them he was going to drive around the neighborhood. Two of his good friends and neighbors Boaz, Oren’s deputy and paramedic, and Oz Sasson, a commander of the emergency squad, arrived ready in their gear without Oren even asking them to come.The first place they checked was the house that was hit by a rocket.As they continued to drive around the kibbutz, they listened to the two-way radio. They heard security coordinators reporting about terrorists infiltrating into many Israeli communities near the Gaza border saying: “Terrorists are going from house to house, purging the houses, and if the army doesn’t come they will slaughter the whole kibbutz…”Oren recounts moment by moment what happens next: “It was like a big wave, a tsunami that was slowly gaining power… At 7:38 am I heard Lotem, the security coordinator of Eshkol, share that he had an encounter with terrorists in Pri-Gan. Then he said, “I’m hurt, I’m disconnecting”. First, I know that he’s not the security coordinator of Pri-Gan, so if he reported it, then it means that their security leader is not there. And if Lotem’s disconnecting, it means that there’s no one else there to help. I also know that the security team in Pri-Gan is not strong enough to be challenged with this ordeal, so I knew that if we didn’t go over there, there would be a massacre…“Oren wrestled with the thought of leaving his own kibbutz to help fight for another one, especially knowing that the terrorists were traveling quickly by motorcycles. He decided to leave half of his strong team at Shlomit. Without hesitation, his two friends Boaz and Oz, joined him to fight in Pri-Gan. As they arrived in Pri-Gan, they could hear shooting and explosions and quickly realized the battle was between civilians and terrorists. They bravely headed toward the terrorists, and on the way, they connected with an emergency squad member of Pri-Gan who was coming out of his house.They joined together for a surprise attack on the terrorists. Oz and Boaz were the first to identify the terrorists, so they started shooting and the terrorists shot back. Some terrorists threw grenades and shot at them, injuring Oz and Boaz. Oz got a bullet in his thigh, and Boaz got a bullet in his back. Oren remembers this horrific moment as he saw his two faithful friends injured: “Boaz tells me ‘I don’t have a lot of time to live’. I heard him telling me ‘5-6 minutes’... he started saying the “Shma” prayer and started confessing. And I say to myself, ‘If Boaz is telling me that he doesn’t have a lot of time, he knows what he’s saying because he’s a paramedic.’ I go into rescue mode, and think, ‘I have only 5-6 minutes. How do I do this? I must get to the vehicle, bring it in a way that the terrorists won’t notice, load Boaz and Oz, and get them out.’ Then, Oz tells me, ‘We must get help’. So I tell him, ‘Get whoever is needed’.“Immediately after getting the call for help, a team from Shlomit started driving towards Pri-Gan. These men understood that every second was significant for rescue and battle. When they arrived, they encountered the terrorists. One person got hit with a bullet that cut his arm in half and collapsed. On the other side of the street, another person got shot in the leg. Oren met with the other security coordinator in the back of a house and they joined to fight and rescue. As Oren went into the street, he saw that one of the guys was with one of the injured team members and was covering him. He was grateful to see him alive and set it in his heart to complete the rescue mission. Meanwhile, another member of the emergency squad was on his way to help but was murdered along the way. Another 4 members of the emergency squad from Shlomit came to help. At this point, you may be wondering who is protecting Oren’s family and community back at Shlomit. This strong community of Shlomit had 2 members of their emergency squad equipped with weapons, along with several other brave residents ready for battle with their handguns. They all joined together to protect the settlement.Back at Pri-Gan, the battle intensified when the terrorists started shooting at two squad members who were hiding next to a very narrow electric pillar. The terrorists shot with such precision and killed both of them. Oren explains: “When I looked through the binoculars I saw that Reuven was killed, and I was left with Moshe and with Michael who is badly injured...” Oren contacted the emergency squad asking for help, and they told him that the army was on the way. A few soldiers showed up but wanted to wait until more soldiers came for reinforcement. It took some time but eventually, the soldiers and emergency squad joined together to fight the terrorists and Oren was able to complete the rescue mission, saving three people.At this point, Oren was amazed that his friends were still alive, but he knew they needed to get to the hospital quickly. At the same time, the terrorists were retreating due to lack of ammunition, injury, and fear of the number of soldiers that were coming to fight against them. Miraculously, not one resident of Pri-Gan was physically injured! The 25 residents of Pri-Gan were in 4 homes inside the safety rooms. Oren and his team heroically fought the terrorists and protected the people of Pri-Gan.Oren and his team brought the people out of the shelters to more protected areas, evacuated the injured, and gathered the ones who lost their lives as they bravely fought against the terrorists. Eventually, the security coordinator of Pri-Gan returned and regained responsibility with the help of the soldiers. After all that happened, Oren was eager to get back to Shlomit to see how his family and community were doing. As soon as he got back, he started preparing his community for a situation of attack. He and his team shared the horrible news of the 3 men from Shlomit who were killed in battle and the 4 men from Shlomit who were wounded in Pri-Gan. This was so hard, especially because they were such close friends and neighbors. Oren finishes the story by saying, “All the credit goes to Shlomit’s emergency squad, and to God almighty who gave us the strength.”This is just one of the many horrific testimonies from October 7th. We acknowledge God’s mighty hand and these brave men who went out of their way to protect the communities of Pri-Gan and Shlomit. We salute Oren, his emergency squad, and the many brave ones who fought to protect this nation. Please continue to pray for all the families that have lost loved ones during this war, and for the soldiers who continue to fight this long and difficult war. And pray for the Lord to continue fighting for Israel and save us from our enemies surrounding us. We also remember the 133 hostages and pray for their release from the hands of Hamas — babies, children, mothers, young women, men, and the elderly. May God set them free and may we see them come home soon!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Oz got a bullet in his thigh, and Boaz got a bullet in his back. <br/><br/>Oren remembers this horrific moment as he saw his two faithful friends injured: <em>“Boaz tells me ‘I don’t have a lot of time to live’. I heard him telling me ‘5-6 minutes’... he started saying the “Shma” prayer and started confessing. And I say to myself, ‘If Boaz is telling me that he doesn’t have a lot of time, he knows what he’s saying because he’s a paramedic.’ I go into rescue mode, and think, ‘I have only 5-6 minutes. How do I do this? I must get to the vehicle, bring it in a way that the terrorists won’t notice, load Boaz and Oz, and get them out.’ Then, Oz tells me, ‘We must get help’. So I tell him, ‘Get whoever is needed’.</em>“<br/><br/>Immediately after getting the call for help, a team from Shlomit started driving towards Pri-Gan. These men understood that every second was significant for rescue and battle. When they arrived, they encountered the terrorists. One person got hit with a bullet that cut his arm in half and collapsed. On the other side of the street, another person got shot in the leg. Oren met with the other security coordinator in the back of a house and they joined to fight and rescue. As Oren went into the street, he saw that one of the guys was with one of the injured team members and was covering him. He was grateful to see him alive and set it in his heart to complete the rescue mission. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, another member of the emergency squad was on his way to help but was murdered along the way. Another 4 members of the emergency squad from Shlomit came to help. <br/><br/>At this point, you may be wondering who is protecting Oren’s family and community back at Shlomit. This strong community of Shlomit had 2 members of their emergency squad equipped with weapons, along with several other brave residents ready for battle with their handguns. They all joined together to protect the settlement.<br/><br/>Back at Pri-Gan, the battle intensified when the terrorists started shooting at two squad members who were hiding next to a very narrow electric pillar. The terrorists shot with such precision and killed both of them. Oren explains: <em>“When I looked through the binoculars I saw that Reuven was killed, and I was left with Moshe and with Michael who is badly injured...” </em>Oren contacted the emergency squad asking for help, and they told him that the army was on the way. A few soldiers showed up but wanted to wait until more soldiers came for reinforcement. It took some time but eventually, the soldiers and emergency squad joined together to fight the terrorists and Oren was able to complete the rescue mission, saving three people.<br/><br/>At this point, Oren was amazed that his friends were still alive, but he knew they needed to get to the hospital quickly. At the same time, the terrorists were retreating due to lack of ammunition, injury, and fear of the number of soldiers that were coming to fight against them. Miraculously, not one resident of Pri-Gan was physically injured! The 25 residents of Pri-Gan were in 4 homes inside the safety rooms. Oren and his team heroically fought the terrorists and protected the people of Pri-Gan.<br/><br/>Oren and his team brought the people out of the shelters to more protected areas, evacuated the injured, and gathered the ones who lost their lives as they bravely fought against the terrorists. Eventually, the security coordinator of Pri-Gan returned and regained responsibility with the help of the soldiers. <br/><br/>After all that happened, Oren was eager to get back to Shlomit to see how his family and community were doing. As soon as he got back, he started preparing his community for a situation of attack. He and his team shared the horrible news of the 3 men from Shlomit who were killed in battle and the 4 men from Shlomit who were wounded in Pri-Gan. This was so hard, especially because they were such close friends and neighbors. <br/><br/>Oren finishes the story by saying,<em> “All the credit goes to Shlomit’s emergency squad, and to God almighty who gave us the strength.”</em><br/><br/>This is just one of the many horrific testimonies from October 7th. We acknowledge God’s mighty hand and these brave men who went out of their way to protect the communities of Pri-Gan and Shlomit. We salute Oren, his emergency squad, and the many brave ones who fought to protect this nation. <br/><br/>Please continue to pray for all the families that have lost loved ones during this war, and for the soldiers who continue to fight this long and difficult war. And pray for the Lord to continue fighting for Israel and save us from our enemies surrounding us. <br/><br/>We also remember the 133 hostages and pray for their release from the hands of Hamas — babies, children, mothers, young women, men, and the elderly. May God set them free and may we see them come home soon!</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear friend,Today is Israel’s National Day of Appreciation for Israel’s Wounded Soldiers and Terror Victims. And now more than ever, this day is extremely significant as Israel is in the midst of a war. Thousands are recent victims of terror, hundreds of Israelis are held hostage, and many soldiers have been wounded. As the war continues, it is so important to take a moment to show our appreciation and love for the ones who have been wounded as they have defended this nation and for those who are victims of the horrific terrorism.The annual day of appreciation for the wounded soldiers and victims of hostilities in Israel began as a local initiative of a youth movement in the southern region of Israel. In July 2014, the Israeli government decided to establish an official day of recognition to express society's moral duty of appreciation towards the wounded and injured. They were the ones who carried in their bodies and souls the public price of us all.On November 29, 1947, the United Nations Assembly decided to end the British mandate and establish the State of Israel. The choice of this date for the National Day of Appreciation symbolizes the connection between the circumstances of the injuries of the victims and the establishment of Israel.In February 1996, after one of the severe terror attacks in Jerusalem, Vision for Israel started helping dozens of families who were victims of hostilities. With heavy hearts, we discovered that four schoolmates of our eldest daughter were killed in these attacks. At Vision for Israel, we have loved and embraced the victims of hostilities since the beginning of our operation. We continue to make it a priority to support and help those and their families who were victims of terror.These wounded soldiers and the victims of hostilities face a wide variety of disabilities and challenges in their daily lives, both physically and mentally. At any time and any opportunity, VFI is committed to supporting victims. We have donated millions of shekels to finance activities for the welfare of victims, as well as individual support for thousands of families. Leading up to October 7th, 2023, Israel had about 100,000 wounded Israeli citizens from war and terror attacks. However, since the October 7th massacre, devastatingly thousands of Israelis were added to this number.As the recent war unfolds, VFI has been readily supplying the victims and their families with food baskets, clothes, basic needs, and more. We are also planning on sponsoring therapy sessions for those dealing with PTSD.On this national day of appreciation, we encourage you to take time to remember the victims, the wounded soldiers, and their families. Join us in showing love and appreciation to these brave Israelis and their families by donating to VFI today!\n\nWith appreciation,Barry & Batya and the VFI Team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,As you may know, the holiday of Purim is celebrated on the 14th day of the month of Adar in the Jewish calendar, which is usually during February or March. This Year, Purim lands on February 26th.It is one of the most joyous holidays on the Jewish calendar, and it commemorates a time when the Jewish people living in Persia were saved from the brink of extermination.Some of the ways we mark the holiday are: reading and hearing the Book of Esther together, acting out the story of Purim, eating sweets and traditional baked goods, dressing up in costumes, giving donations to the poor, and sending out goodie baskets to family and friends.Every year, around the time of Purim, Vision for Israel reaches out to many underprivileged people as well as hundreds of terror victim families to warm their hearts with joyful events. We provide activities for the children and families, and give them a day full of pleasant, stress-free experiences.In Israel today, there are tens of thousands of families who suffer from severe anxiety due to terror attacks, survivors of the Holocaust, people who are in great distress. Some of them are injured physically, and some are injured emotionally. The events that we host for them are sometimes the only times they’re able to leave their homes and be around people without extreme anxiety. These special events of Purim parties have been a fundamental gift to put a smile on their faces.We have been in this pandemic crisis for over a year, unparalleled in our generation. At the same time, it is increasingly clear to us that our joy does not come from mass gatherings and celebrations—happiness and contentment come from our relationship with God Himself. Within us lies the power to enhance the atmosphere around us, and amongst our family members.Our challenge is to assist at least one thousand families in the time between this Purim and Passover, with a financial gift of US $150.Will you help us bless these families? Will you show your love to these people—the way God showed His mercy to Esther, and delivered the Jewish people from peril?\n\nFor the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor. Esther 8:16\n\nMay the Lord bless and keep you.\n\nIn His Service,\n\nBarry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

As a faithful supporter of our work, we would like to share some important news regarding poverty in Israel and our organization's efforts to eradicate it, especially during this Passover season.It's no secret that Israel has been facing a challenging economic situation, with rising inflation and the devastating impact of terror attacks against civilians. Many families and seniors are struggling to make ends meet, with some even living below the poverty line. The recent poverty report for 2021 revealed that approximately 854,000 children and 212,000 pensioners are living in poverty, and the numbers are only getting worse.Vision for Israel is committed to fighting poverty in various ways and providing solutions and hope. With your ongoing support, we can continue to provide essential aid and support to those in need. We believe in the principles of mutual guarantee, social responsibility, empathy, compassion, and concern for the needs of the weak population in society, as stated in Deuteronomy 24:17-19:\n\nYou are not to twist justice for an outsider or orphan, and you are not to take as collateral a widow’s clothing. But you are to remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Adonai your God redeemed you from there. Therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you are not to turn back to get it. It is for the outsider, for the orphan and for the widow—in order that Adonai your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.\n\nYour efforts have made a difference, but we still have a long way to go. We are working hard to provide diverse aid for populations that need assistance. Together, we can ensure an exit from poverty to a life with dignity and with the head held high.This Passover season, we had a goal of providing gift cards to 1000 families. We are excited to tell you that thanks to your response, we have been able to meet, and even surpass this goal! Our team has been going to different locations throughout the country over the last few weeks to distribute this essential aid. The reports they shared with us are of broken people, who are overjoyed to receive this valuable financial gift.\n\nImagine the stress and weight parents are enduring because they are drowning in expenses as they try to provide for their family. It is thanks to your generosity that they can place food on the table and celebrate the Passover with joy and dignity. Your help really makes a significant impact on their lives and provides hope for a better future.As we move forward, Vision for Israel will continue to expand the circle of recipients of aid and support.

Our efforts are directly contributing to the emergency aid needed for the victims affected by this devastating conflict.This Shabbat, as we reflect on this and prepare our hearts to gather and give thanks, we're reminded of the powerful narrative of Parashat Toldot in the book of Genesis (Gen. 25:19-28:9), a tale of family, heritage, and the immense weight of blessings. In the story of Isaac, Rebecca, and their sons, Jacob and Esau, we see two distinct individuals destined to shape the future of their family and, indeed, the world.Rebecca, burdened with a turbulent pregnancy, hears from God that the twins she carries will become \"two nations,\" with diverging destinies. Esau, the hunter, lives for the immediate pleasures of the world. Jacob, on the other hand, embodies a deeper sense of purpose. This dichotomy not only defines their lives but also underscores the eternal struggle between transient satisfaction and lasting legacy. It’s believed that Esau was the forefather of Edom (today’s Jordan), the sworn enemy of Israel in biblical times. In today’s world, it is believed that part of the Arab and Muslim world originated from Edom. It's a struggle we witness today, as our brothers and sisters in Israel face attacks and the loss of loved ones, choosing the path of resilience and enduring hope over despair.In a defining moment, Esau relinquishes his birthright for a bowl of lentil stew, opting for immediate gratification over eternal blessing.

Your partnership has enabled us to respond swiftly and effectively after the horrific Hamas destruction on October 7th and during Israel's recent conflict, the Swords of Iron War. Vision for Israel provided essential aid to those who are suffering from this massacre and are most affected.Together, we've achieved remarkable feats — touching countless lives in Israel. This year's achievements stand as a testament to the power of collective faith and action in the Lord God of Israel. In these challenging times, your donations have been instrumental in helping us deliver crucial assistance. Vision for Israel placed dozens of safety shelters during this last year, which helped save countless lives from the rocket attacks. We have equipped several defense squads and alert units with tactical gear including bulletproof vests and helmets, ensuring the safety of those who protect Israel. Vision for Israel donated two more ambulances and two more ATVs. Our team has also distributed food baskets to hundreds of families in the southern cities and communities that have suffered relentless missile attacks.Moreover, we have extended our support to the brave volunteers of rescue organizations. By providing 200 tactical medic kits and protective gear, we have enabled them to save lives under the most harrowing conditions. We also responded to the urgent needs of soldiers in Gaza and in the north, supplying mattresses, warm blankets, and warm winter jackets for better rest and preparedness.\n\nBut the work is far from over. As the war continues, and the aftermath will leave a lasting impact, the road to recovery is long. Families in cities like Sderot, Netivot, Ashkelon, Ashdod, and Ofakim, and other communities where families evacuated their homes, many of those who have faced the horrors of war, continue to struggle and need the ongoing support of our team and partners.As this year concludes, we ask you to consider the potential changes in tax deductions for charitable giving in the USA. A year-end donation to Vision for Israel could provide you with tax benefits while significantly aiding in restoring lives to those who are in despair and brokenhearted in Israel.Your generous contribution will enable us to continue our work in these trying times, offering hope and practical assistance to those who depend on us.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friend,In the words of American abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher, “It's the heart that makes a man rich. He is rich according to what he is, not according to what he has.” We write to you today with a tale of heart, of richness, and of the incredible strength that comes from renewal.Moshe was a mere child when the nightmare of the Holocaust descended upon his world. The tight-knit community he knew, and the loving family that surrounded him, all were brutally snatched away. He witnessed the unimaginable—his loved ones perish in the terrifying churn of a world gone awry.

The intense hardships he faced, and his strength and resilience in overcoming them, remind us of the thousands of Holocaust survivors we aim to support.Please be aware that while Moshe is not a direct recipient of our aid, his story reflects the experiences of those we serve daily.

Many people use this time to plan changes in their lives. There is a lot to reflect on this year as terror, famine, and illness continue to sweep the globe. Many of us feel scared or hopeless as if we are too small and insignificant to overcome all the hardships we face.Feeling helpless, worrying about this Goliath in our lives can pave the way for a retreat into a cycle of fear—the result of which is despair, stagnation, and inaction. As believers, we rely on God's promise to act in our lives. God is always present, giving us the strength and protection to keep going. When we feel hopeless, we must wrap ourselves in the coat of faith and ward off fear from our lives. Especially when we are in a sense of weakness and helplessness, it is time to give of ourselves to others. The strength of faith is the source of the courage we have to overcome every giant before us.\n\nThe team at Vision for Israel understands the giants we face from time to time. When we are tested, challenged, or short on funds, we press on with the hope and continue to serve the underprivileged in our communities. Moving forward has allowed us to grow through the most difficult of times. We are happy to say that our plan is to expand our giving in 2022. VFI plans a higher budget and our goal is to increase the assistance to help more people in the coming year, spreading more love and care.As David faced Goliath, we face issues that are far bigger than we are. If we hope to prevail, we must depend on God to support us. Just as He gave David his courage to face the giant, your support gives us the ammunition to strike down poverty, sickness, and violence in our communities.Be encouraged and join us in turning our fears into actions and consider becoming a monthly partner. This kind of reliable support allows us to plan for the future, and take down bigger and more pressing challenges in Israel. The more support we have, the more Goliaths we can fight—and the more action we take, the more we see God in our lives. His presence helps to eliminate our fears and gives us the push we need to keep doing our work.Dear partners, let us stand together with greater commitment to support and strengthen Vision for Israel this year so we can accomplish much more than ever before. Our prayer for each of you is the same as our prayer for ourselves—that we continue to develop the courage to grow as people of great strength; fearless and bold in our faith.May the Lord bless and keep you,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friend,As people of faith, we hold dear the values of liberty and freedom in Israel and worldwide. As we come together with our loved ones to commemorate the 4th of July—America's Independence Day—we reflect on the values that unify America as a nation: liberty, resilience, and an unwavering spirit of unity. These principles reverberate not only within our borders but extend beyond, reaching out to those burdened by the weight of past atrocities and challenges.Among those bearing such burdens are Holocaust survivors. Both those who have passed and those who remain alive are living testaments. Their stories of courage and resilience profoundly touch us—their survival against unimaginable odds speaks volumes of their indomitable spirit. Vision for Israel has had the privilege of serving these heroes, seizing every opportunity to bring joy, comfort, and honor to their remarkable journeys.Recently, VFI took on the task of assisting these heroes by providing comfort during their twilight years. Some cannot afford to purchase basic personal hygiene items. VFI was asked to deliver a package of disposable hygienic products each month valued at $120 per person, customized to each individual's needs and delivered to their homes. This initiative is a pilot project for 100 survivors and, with sufficient funding, can be extended to assist more survivors.Your generous support can ensure that these valiant individuals, who have weathered life's harshest storms, receive the respect and care they truly deserve. You can help alleviate their financial strains, contribute to their well-being, and, most importantly, remind them that they are not forgotten.Alongside these survivors, new immigrants from various parts of the world have sought solace on Israel's shores. Fleeing from adversity and hardship, they arrived in Israel in search of a fresh start. Vision for Israel extends support to these individuals too, helping them find stability in a new land.As we celebrate our freedom and independence this 4th of July, we invite you to extend your blessings to these two distinct groups in Israel—the Holocaust survivors, who have endured the unimaginable, and the new immigrants seeking a fresh start.Your contributions help provide financial assistance, organize community events, offer warm blankets for winter, food baskets, hygienic products, and much more. Together, we can ensure that the spirit of Independence Day resonates not only for us but for those in need in Israel as well.Click here to donate now and designate your donation to Aid to the Poor.\n\nWishing you all a Happy 4th of July!Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nOctober 7th, 2023, will be remembered as the day in which evil-doers, cursed, bloodthirsty terrorists, raped women, murdered thousands of Israelis, and kidnapped children, teenagers, women, men, and the elderly. Many lives were taken that day and during this war, and yet, many lives were saved through the shelters placed in these southern communities that were hit with an absurd amount of rockets. One of the areas that were hit the hardest during the October 7th attack was the Eshkol region. Many of the residents of the settlements in this region are security officers, reservists, and strong heroic citizens. These brave citizens and heroes defended their communities with their own hands and saved many lives. We also recognize the trauma they have been through because they were the ones to witness firsthand their friends and family being murdered and slaughtered. The cruelty and wickedness are something we have not seen since the founding of Israel and in the modern history of the people of Israel.By God’s grace and your faithful support, Barry and VFI became well known to the Eshkol Regional Council over the last two and a half years due to the large number of shelters donated. We are grateful to have built relationships with these people before the war and now, we can love and support them in even deeper ways.As we communicated with the emergency response teams in the Eshkol Regional Council, we discovered their need for equipment and immediately started raising funds for those items. We were able to raise the funds to purchase defibrillators, radio devices, and scanning flashlights for 32 teams. The total cost of all of this donation was 500,000 Shekels.On January 17th, 2024 we were invited to personally give the equipment to the security officers of the 32 settlements in the Eshkol Region. There were new security officers that we didn’t know because sadly, nine were murdered in the massacre of October 7th. However, many of the security officers recognized Barry and knew him as a hard-working and caring donor who came to all the placements of the shelters to protect the residents. They thanked us and told us that hundreds of lives were saved as a result of those shelters.The commander of all the security officers in the Eshkol Region led the event along with the head of the council. They expressed deep appreciation for the donation of equipment that is contributing to the defense of their communities during the war. They shared their heavy grief, severe trauma, deep loneliness, and feeling unsupported. They expressed the heart-wrenching pain of the murder of hundreds of local residents and many of their friends who are still held hostage in Gaza. We could see and hear the sorrow and pain they were going through. And yet, we also saw their resilient hearts to fight and protect what is dear to them — their home.\n\nMost of the families in these communities have been evacuated until the war ends, their communities are restored, and new security measures are in place. And yet, these security officers remain in their communities near Gaza to defend their nation and their people.Batya and Barry expressed their great appreciation to all the security personnel. Batya said, \"You know that the greater the pain, the greater our spiritual strength. Thanks to God’s plan, we are here. Faith brought us here. We were persecuted in the diaspora, but now we have a home. Our spirit will not be broken. We have many friends around the world who love us and know that the nation of Israel is alive. There are many dear Christians who love Israel, and thanks to their generous support we can give you these donations today. If they could, they would come to fight for us here, and some would even send their children to help fight, too. You may not hear them and their voices, but we are here to tell you that they are many and they mean what they say.”After this, Shai, our VFI team member, presented the donation. Each emergency response team received one kit, which included: 1 defibrillator, 3 radio devices, and 3 scanning lights.Vision for Israel will continue to do as much as we can to support the settlements in the south during this war and afterward, until they are fully restored. We came to encourage them, and they encouraged us. We came to strengthen them, and they strengthened us.Our VFI team wants to give our partners, donors, and friends around the world a strong hug and big thanks for all of the love and support that you have so faithfully given to this nation. You, our dear friends, are the silent heroes! God sees your generous hearts, your faithfulness to Him, and your support of His Jewish people.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,In the wake of Israel's high holidays, we enter the month of November with a sobering sense of reality. The new year and the festive joy of Sukkot have given way to cooler weather and the darker, longer nights of fall. In the air, there is a deep melancholy, as we face continuous threats to our very existence. From increasing aggression in Yemen and Iran to the heightened activity of our defense forces in Lebanon and Gaza, nowhere in Israel is truly safe. Every city, town, and village feels the weight of constant vigilance.At Vision for Israel, we stand firm in the belief that God is with us in these uncertain times. His hand of protection is over Israel, and we trust Him to safeguard us from all evil. As Psalm 91:4 reminds us, \"He will cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you will find refuge.\" But even as we rely on His divine shield, we know that there are practical steps we must take to protect our people.This is why our work continues at full speed. In the face of growing dangers, VFI remains committed to installing safety shelters in Israel’s most vulnerable areas. To date, we have placed close to 400 bomb shelters throughout the southern and northern regions. But as threats persist, it is becoming clear that our efforts need to expand. Central Israel, along with other parts of the country, now faces the same dangers, and we must be prepared to act.We cannot do this alone. We need your help.Your support is critical to ensuring that we can continue this vital mission. Every bomb shelter installed represents a life saved—a family protected. When sirens sound and rockets fly, these shelters become sanctuaries of safety. They give parents and children precious moments to reach safety, and they offer peace of mind to those living under constant threat.Now is the time to act. As Israel faces rising threats, we need your help more than ever. Please consider donating today to ensure that every family has a safe place to turn when danger strikes by dedicating it to Medical & Disaster Relief. You can also call our office and speak with one of our representatives if you prefer to donate by phone. Your gift—no matter the size—will help save lives and provide security in some of Israel's most dangerous areas.As we face these uncertain days, let us remember that God is our ultimate protector. But He has also called us to be His hands and feet, to act in love and generosity for the sake of others.

When the head of the local council and the security officer of Yanu’ach-Jat asked us if we could help them with emergency equipment for their defense team, Vision for Israel responded by purchasing 40 ceramic vests, 40 helmets, 5 medic bags, two doctor/paramedic bags, 15 scanning lights, and 5 stretchers for their team.At the beginning of the month, our team traveled to the village to deliver the equipment. In a dignified and impressive ceremony, the equipment was presented to the head of the council, Mr. Mo’adad (Modi) Sa’ad, the council's security officer Zaharan Nazal, officials in the council, and members of the defense team.The head of the council gave a speech, in which he expressed his deep gratitude to Vision for Israel. He pointed out that a contribution to the Druze citizens is not taken for granted, welcomed VFI’s cooperation, and expressed a desire to preserve it.Barry also shared about the meaning and importance of the courageous bond that exists between Jewish Israelis and members of the Druze community. He also explained VFI's vision to support every citizen who contributes to the State of Israel.The Yanu’ach-Jat Council awarded Batya and Barry with a token of appreciation for their activity in protecting the village in a time of emergency. At the end of the ceremony, the head of the council led our team on a personal tour to a park dedicated to the memory of the fallen heroes.VFI is honored to contribute to the defense of the Druze communities, whose residents serve the state of Israel with great dedication and courage to risk their lives for the security of us all.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

And as you probably already know, it’s a very special time—a holy time set aside to reflect on the year past and to ground ourselves in preparation for Yom Kippur. It’s a time of renewal, and of deep reflection as we look at our relationship with God and with the people in our lives over the past year. Especially during the High Holidays, God is asking us to remember the poorest among us and lift them up in any way that we can.\n\nThis has never been more necessary, as our world is constantly plagued with violence, disease, and loss of faith. The poor among us have suffered more than we can know—not only undergoing a pandemic as we have—but living in poverty and with food and housing insecurity. When considering the poor, we must make sure that we are humble, and that we put ourselves in a place of service. In order to truly care for the poor, we must acknowledge that we are no better than they are. We are equal in the eyes of God, so we must understand that the poor are our brethren and our peers. Remember, Yeshua walked the earth with humility. He aligned Himself with the lowly, the poor, and the sinner. In like manner, God’s grace is found in all walks of life. During this time of reflection, we should also consider why we give alms. When performing acts of mercy, we remember that we do so because our Lord has been generous and merciful to us. We did nothing to earn His love and reward, yet He gives it to us unconditionally. So we also must turn to our brothers and sisters in need, and help them with mercy and generosity. No human being needs to earn the Lord’s love, and neither should they have to earn grace from their earthly peers. By caring for the weakest and the least fortunate among us, we infuse our communities with strength, prosperity, and hope for the future. During Rosh Hashanah, this hope and prosperity are especially fitting. We must begin this new year looking toward the future and refocusing on our walk with God.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,On June 26, 2024, we hosted another uplifting event at Vision for Israel’s headquarters — the Millennium Center, welcoming 55 Holocaust survivors. It was a joyous occasion filled with music, singing, dancing, and a delightful brunch. The event, held in Hebrew, Russian, and English, created an intimate and heartwarming atmosphere. Witnessing these precious individuals enjoy the remaining years of their lives always brings tears to our eyes.During this gathering, we also dedicated our 9th ambulance to Magen David Adom in Israel. This specially ordered 4x4 van, equipped for rough terrain, was a significant milestone, especially with Holocaust survivors joining us for this special moment. This mirrors the dedication of our 8th ambulance, which was dedicated a few months ago, and shared with a different group of survivors.The importance of these gatherings cannot be overstated. Many survivors have shared that the greatest challenge in their elderly years is loneliness. Vision for Israel provides essential support: financial aid, blankets, duvets, heaters in winter, food supplies during holidays, towels, and other necessities. Yet, these provisions alone cannot heal the soul of someone haunted by the horrors they endured or the loss of a spouse.In April 2023, the Holocaust Survivors’ Rights Authority reported 147,199 survivors living in Israel. By May 2024, this number had dropped to 132,826, a stark reminder of how quickly we are losing these precious souls. Tragically, approximately 15,000 survivors passed away in just one year.The Foundation for the Welfare of Holocaust Victims has highlighted the ongoing struggles: 51% of survivors report they cannot afford to cover their basic household expenses. Thousands live in poverty. Bureaucratic challenges make it difficult for many to access the assistance they desperately need. These elderly individuals are often too frail to navigate government systems and feel forgotten.The recent conflict has compounded their trauma. On October 7th, about 2,500 Holocaust survivors in southern Israel experienced new horrors, reminiscent of their past. Around 2,000 were forced to evacuate, and now, some are fleeing the north due to threats from Hezbollah. This brings back painful memories of my own (Barry’s) grandmother's suffering during pogroms in Belarus.Despite efforts by the Welfare Ministry and other agencies, the needs of Holocaust survivors far exceed available resources. Within a decade, most of these survivors will be gone, while global anti-Semitism rises alarmingly. We must not let our elderly survivors feel abandoned. We must stand with them, offer encouragement, and show them the love of God. Your support is crucial. More social events, increased funding for essentials, and addressing their various needs can significantly impact their lives. Now is the time to act. Your generosity will help Vision for Israel sustain their hope and extend their lives.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,On the evening of December 14, Jewish families around the world will kindle the first Hanukkah light. We’ll gather around tables, tell stories of God’s faithfulness, and watch the glow of the candles push back the early winter night. Hanukkah is the Feast of Lights and also a feast of home, of warmth, and of family. Yet for many children in Israel this winter, the table is bare, the apartment is cold, and the sense of safety is fragile.In November, we shared about a new initiative within our feeding program: partnering with local “Warm House” centers that welcome children at risk after school. These hubs offer what every child needs to thrive—a hot, nutritious meal; a quiet place to study; caring adults who are present and consistent; and a safe, supervised environment to breathe, laugh, and heal. When a child arrives hungry and leaves nourished in body and spirit, that single evening can change the next morning.Families are still rebuilding their lives after the upheavals of the past two years. Some remain displaced, and many children wake in fear and uncertainty. In this environment, the simplest acts—sitting down to a steaming bowl of soup, hearing someone call your name with kindness, finding a place at a real table—become lifelines.Because of your generosity, Vision for Israel has a proven track record of responding quickly and compassionately. From our logistics center, we mobilized within hours to deliver relief to survivors and evacuees. Thousands received food staples, hygiene items, baby supplies, and store vouchers for dignity of choice, while children and parents accessed counseling and safe spaces to begin healing. That same commitment to practical mercy is what drives this Warm House initiative.Here is what your help will make possible in a Warm House: consistent hot meals for school nights so that children can concentrate and grow; wholesome snacks that sustain energy for homework and play, and the steady presence of trained staff and volunteers who know the children by name. Together, we can equip these centers to serve more kids each week, keep kitchens stocked, and ensure every plate carries both nutrition and dignity.Hanukkah teaches us that even a small flame can light an entire room. When we place one candle in the window, we declare that darkness does not win. Every hot meal, every seat pulled up to the table, every caring voice saying “We’re glad you’re here” is a candle set in a child’s night. When a community Warm House fills with laughter and the smell of freshly cooked food, we catch a glimpse of what restoration can look like.Our prayer is to multiply that light across Israel’s most vulnerable neighborhoods. One Warm House can brighten a street; several can brighten a city. And when you add your light to ours, a miracle can unfold that is every bit as real as oil that burned longer than expected: children who came in anxious leave at peace; children who came in hungry leave filled; children who felt unseen discover they are cherished.The annual cost of the feeding program is 80,000 ILS (about $24,500) per home. Our goal is to help more than one Warm House. Will you join us in reaching Israel's most vulnerable and bring light into their darkness? Please give generously today so that more children can sit down to a warm meal, a safe space, and a hopeful tomorrow.

He can’t work due to his medical condition.\n\nIn 1996 he was ambushed by radical terrorists and they stoned him. In self-defense, he responded by shooting at the ground to drive them away and one of the terrorists claimed that he got injured. This led to over 15 years of legal battles resulting in very big financial distress. But that was far from the end of the tragedy.\n\nBoaz then lost his wife and three of their children in a separate terror attack in 2002. Thankfully Boaz and four of his children survived. His son Asael tells a powerful story:\n\n“In the year 2002 a terrorist broke into our house and shot to death my mother and three of my brothers. I was shot in my right leg--three bullets left me severely wounded. My leg was amputated afterward. I was nine years old. My family went through a terrible trauma; our house was burnt down, I spent two years in the hospital following that terrible night.”\n\nA few years ago, Boaz who was a medic, was called to a terror attack site, where he discovered that his son’s friend’s parents were murdered.\n\nAt the Shiva, he was trying to bring light, hope, and faith.\n\n“My message is that the people of Israel are overcomers and are not afraid. In my case, they wanted to destroy my family—and still, I rose up again, despite the ongoing pain and difficulty. They murdered my wife and three children, but 4 survived, and after remarriage, we have triplets and the house is full of light. We adopted a son 7 years ago and truly there is a lot of joy. I always ask myself, what would Rachel want me to do? The drastic change between the life I had to the new life is hard, there is no school that teaches that.”\n\nAccording to him, coping is difficult but you must get up on your feet.\n\n“I relive the attack all the time. Every little event startles me. [When] I’m on a trip up north, I remember where my son hiked. My dear ones were born in Itamar and were murdered there, and I also buried them there. But we move on, that’s the answer. To raise a family and more families and more children, because the People of Israel is alive.”\n\nBoaz is proud to tell his son’s Asah’el extraordinary success story, who was severely injured in the terror attack and lost his leg.\n\n“He was 9 years old at the time, and he took control of himself. From the day that he woke up in intensive care, he always told me, dad, I want to do everything by myself. I told him, but you don’t have a leg. He insisted on jumping on one leg.\n\nToday he is a grown man. But in the first few years, I accompanied him every day with a lot of difficulties. Sometimes I carried him in my arms until he learned how to walk. Today he is an exceptional swimmer and also a basketball player in Israel’s Disabled Team and he represented Israel in the Rio de Janeiro Paralympics (2016).\n\nToday it doesn’t bother him, he feels like he has 2 legs. He has fun, works, and teaches swimming. He finished his bachelor’s degree in Phy Ed at Wingate. He teaches children to swim and he managed to teach a girl who didn’t want to get out of a wheelchair to swim. I know that the whole subject of terror attacks still hurts him, but he goes on. That is the hope and that is the continuity.”\n\nBoaz is such an inspiration to us—having lived through tragedies that most of us will never experience, yet keeping an optimistic and positive outlook on life. He has no income due to his injuries from the terror attack. Yet he now finds himself with a huge debt. We at Vision for Israel want to help alleviate some of this debt. Will you join us and help Boaz and his family get out of this huge debt?\n\nVFI is supporting the family to cover their balanced debt of $65,000.

For Tu-Bishvat, we hosted 50 survivors from Be'er-Sheva at the Millennium Center for social fellowship centered around a flower arranging activity.\n\nBarry and Batya welcomed the survivors with an accordionist as they disembarked from their bus, and ushered them into the hall for a delicious brunch. The day's activity included a singalong session, which led some of the survivors to dance joyfully.\n\nThe flower arranging workshop began after dessert. The survivors learned how to cut and arrange the flowers in a classic style. Some of our generous volunteers handed out the flowers and provided assistance for those who needed it. To cap off the event, the survivors received useful gifts such as bed linens, towels, scarves, and hats.\n\nShortly after the event, we received a thank you letter from the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust Survivors that read in part: \"We received positive and moving feedback from the Holocaust survivors who participated in this event, and they were thankful for the opportunity you gave them—getting out of the house to lessen the loneliness, and to enjoy a delightful and cultural event.\n\nThe survivors told us that this is one of the most amazing events that they got to participate in, that they [thoroughly] enjoyed it, and that they haven't had this much fun in a long time, that it was special, and they will remember this event until the end of their days...\".\n\nWe are honored and privileged to invest your donations in the continued care and support of our beloved survivors.

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear friends,During our 28 years as an organization, Vision for Israel has always worked directly with families and children in poverty who are in need of support. Providing food for the hungry is one of our main objectives. In the last few years, we have seen an increase in the poverty rate and the number of children suffering from hunger.When our team visited Riki for the first time we learned she was a single mother with 3 kids. She was a heavy-set woman who lost most of her hair. Her nails were broken and she was explaining that she and her kids are eating bread, pasta, and rice and that she couldn't afford to buy any nutritious food. She was explaining that she suffers from pain in parts of her body. When she opened the fridge, we saw a few slices of bread and margarine. That's when we realized that there are hundreds of thousands of people like Riki. Nutritional insecurity is one of the hallmarks of poverty. Many people who experience poverty cannot get the proper nutrients that they need because they do not have access to healthy food sources. Hunger causes damage to both physical and mental health and can ostracize families from their communities.Children are particularly vulnerable to the lack of nutritional food because they are still developing, and they need proper nutrients to grow. The lack of it can cause them to fall behind in their education or become excluded from their peers. The percentage of children suffering from food insecurity is particularly high among families who are falling under the poverty line. For those who receive a monthly allowance from the Israeli National Security, there is a high percentage ofArab, ultra-Orthodox families, and families receiving disability stipends.The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the situation and caused a rise in food insecurity for these communities. As a result, there has been an increase in applications for welfare aid. Charitable organizations are dealing with increased demand, and Vision for Israel is no exception.Those families who have been supported by Vision for Israel feelthey are part of the family. We visit hundreds of families every month to keep the provision going. Each family receivesabasket with high-quality nutritional food.As there has been an increase in poverty, we have had to increase our output. Your support of $100 to Vision for Israel, will provide an entire family with a gift card to buy food. By giving $50, we can provide a family with a food basket filled with nutritious food products.We hope to continue to grow so that we may help as many people as possible. We trust you, our friends and supporters, to help us make a difference for the poor and hungry in Israel.It is always a joy to know we are making a difference and we all have the opportunity to partake in it. Please donate here.May the Lord bless you and keep you.Your friends,Barry, Batya, and the VFI Team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nWe are privileged when we have the rare opportunity to sit with Holocaust survivors, listen to their heroic stories, and learn from their bravery.We recently met Frieda*, born in 1935 in Lithuania, whose wisdom and hope were integral to her inspiring testimony.Frieda grew up in Lithuania in a well-off family - her father was a prosperous businessman in textile and had contacts worldwide.The political and social climate was tense and came to a boiling point. Even before the Germans invaded Lithuania in 1941, the Lithuanians began murdering Jews, 'cleaning out' the Jews from 150 villages, calling them 'Judenfrei' villages, meaning free of Jews.They would murder the Jews in incredibly cruel and public manners, decapitating a Rabbi and displaying his head in a window, herding Jews into a synagogue and setting it on fire, or waterboarding them to death on the streets as onlookers smiled cruelly.When Frieda was about five years old, the Jews in were forced to pin the yellow star badge with the word 'Jew' to identify as Jewish citizens and a symbol of mockery.It was against the law for Jews to leave their house without them. One day as Frieda’s grandmother stood in line to get bread, she forgot to wear her yellow star. Her neighbor denounced her, and her grandmother was taken and never seen again. As the Germans invaded, Jews were taken to ghettos and forced labor camps. As Frieda told her impossible yet unfortunately true story, we held our breath and took in every word as she described the early days of the war as 'horrific': \"We only took a few possessions; I remember my mother trying to take a huge ficus plant; she didn't know what was happening. My grandfather, who was well off and prosperous, was taken first so that his apartment could be plundered; I was told later that he was humiliated and tortured before being killed\".Once Frieda and her family arrived at the ghetto, they realized no one would ever make it out alive. The German guards would round up the people to see who was useful and who wasn't - the elderly and children were dispensable. Somehow, miraculously, Rosian Frieda and her parents were spared. Time was not on their side, as they knew they would not survive unless they were to find a way to escape, as Frieda recalls:\"My parents timed the guards with their dogs and their searchlights and attempted to dig a hole under the barbwire to see if they could help me escape; each time they did - they risked their lives. It was a tedious procedure because it was only a matter of minutes between the changing of the guards.They dug a hole big enough for me as a 5-1/2 to 6-year-old to pass through. They pushed me through, and on the other side was my father's secretary, that was waiting for me in the shadows. She took me across the river bridge to her apartment.I was crying so much because I didn't understand what was happening, and she couldn't keep me because I was endangering her life\".Fortunately, the selfless and life-risking act of her father's secretary saved her life as she found a new place for her to live in a place where a group of journalists would meet. Natasha, a journalist and Frieda's mother's best friend transferred her to her sister, who had a farm in the countryside. At the farm, Frieda was always on the run and constantly at risk of being discovered when people's suspicion arose, attempting always to blend in and make herself invisible.Like many brave gentiles today, called 'righteous among the nations', the woman covered up Frieda's identity by lying, saying that it was her sister's illegitimate child whom she had taken under her roof.Amongst the unimaginable pain of being separated from her family, these women were like mothers to Frieda, so much so that she even called them 'mother'.Miraculously, Frieda’s mother was with her at the end of the war when Soviet troops liberated them in 1944.Although the war was over and her mother and father survived, the trauma of those horror-stricken years haunted her:\"The fear was always there; there were Germans coming by and searching, and I couldn't understand why they were trying to kill me since I always tried to be a good girl. I was a target for murder; this trauma stays with me to this day, the fear and trust issues.\"For many survivors, the pain is too difficult to speak of ever again; for Frieda, her story is an opportunity to speak out against racism and challenge Holocaust deniers: \"People seem to have their own agenda for denial and distortion because it is too difficult for them to comprehend there were miles and miles of corpses. It's like thinking about eternity or infinity - it's too great for some people. For some people, antisemitism, being anti-Israel, is the way to express themselves and fits their personal agenda and their political views\".If it (the Holocaust) hadn't happened and it wouldn't have sat on the world's conscience for several years after it happened, and if the records weren't there that the Germans kept themselves, it would have been much easier for them to bury them (evidence of the Holocaust).It's like Niccolò Machiavelli said: \"You repeat a lie often enough that it can become a reality,\" and that's the danger because when you live alone and don't see the truth, you yourself become contaminated. And we have to fight (Holocaust denial) that with all our might.If the new generations can see that there is a way out, that we can create a better world, and put our heart, soul, and spirit in that path, then they see will see the light and share it with their families and friends. This can go on for generations and generations, just as we Jews have.I am here to tell this story. This is the continuity of Jews, and it will never stop, and Hitler lost'. She added with a victorious smile. Frieda and her family are living proof of the hope that continues to live on throughout the generations. Her mother lived to the age of 101, her father to 96, and she herself has two sons and eight grandchildren.God has strengthened His people to survive history's darkest times and put the spirit of truth and justice in their hearts to stand against antisemitism.When you support Vision for Israel, you are not just giving a basket of food or a warm heaters and blanket to the elderly in the cold winters, but you are helping people such as Frieda preserve her legacy as one of the remaining Holocaust survivors.You are taking a stand against antisemitism by acknowledging the real stories and heroic stories of Jews and the gentiles who risked their lives to save them. In today's world, where antisemitism is rearing its ugly head again and Jews are moving back to Israel to escape racist violence - we are grateful to have the support of our partners in the nations as Israel continues to rebuild itself as a nation rising from the ashes.Thank you for supporting us - so that we can support heroes like Frieda.*Name has been changed.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Natasha, a journalist and Frieda's mother's best friend transferred her to her sister, who had a farm in the countryside. <br/><br/>At the farm, Frieda was always on the run and constantly at risk of being discovered when people's suspicion arose, attempting always to blend in and make herself invisible.<br/><br/>Like many brave gentiles today, called 'righteous among the nations', the woman covered up Frieda's identity by lying, saying that it was her sister's illegitimate child whom she had taken under her roof.<br/><br/>Amongst the unimaginable pain of being separated from her family, these women were like mothers to Frieda, so much so that she even called them 'mother'.<br/><br/>Miraculously, Frieda’s mother was with her at the end of the war when Soviet troops liberated them in 1944.<br/><br/>Although the war was over and her mother and father survived, the trauma of those horror-stricken years haunted her:<br/><br/>\"The fear was always there; there were Germans coming by and searching, and I couldn't understand why they were trying to kill me since I always tried to be a good girl. I was a target for murder; this trauma stays with me to this day, the fear and trust issues.\"<br/><br/>For many survivors, the pain is too difficult to speak of ever again; for Frieda, her story is an opportunity to speak out against racism and challenge Holocaust deniers: <br/><br/>\"People seem to have their own agenda for denial and distortion because it is too difficult for them to comprehend there were miles and miles of corpses. It's like thinking about eternity or infinity - it's too great for some people. For some people, antisemitism, being anti-Israel, is the way to express themselves and fits their personal agenda and their political views\".<br/><br/>If it (the Holocaust) hadn't happened and it wouldn't have sat on the world's conscience for several years after it happened, and if the records weren't there that the Germans kept themselves, it would have been much easier for them to bury them (evidence of the Holocaust).<br/><br/>It's like Niccolò Machiavelli said: <br/><br/>\"You repeat a lie often enough that it can become a reality,\" and that's the danger because when you live alone and don't see the truth, you yourself become contaminated. And we have to fight (Holocaust denial) that with all our might.<br/><br/>If the new generations can see that there is a way out, that we can create a better world, and put our heart, soul, and spirit in that path, then they see will see the light and share it with their families and friends. This can go on for generations and generations, just as we Jews have.<br/><br/>I am here to tell this story. This is the continuity of Jews, and it will never stop, and <strong>Hitler lost'</strong>. She added with a victorious smile. <br/><br/>Frieda and her family are living proof of the hope that continues to live on throughout the generations. Her mother lived to the age of 101, her father to 96, and she herself has two sons and eight grandchildren.<br/><br/>God has strengthened His people to survive history's darkest times and put the spirit of truth and justice in their hearts to stand against antisemitism.<br/><br/>When you support </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,As we prepare our hearts and homes for the festive Passover season, a time of reflection on the liberation of the people of Israel from Egypt, our spirits are burdened by a modern-day plight that mirrors the ancient cry for freedom. Today, we stand united in our plea to Hamas: \"Let my people go.\" This appeal is drawn from the depths of our hearts as we consider the harrowing ordeal of the hostages currently held in Gaza.The situation in Gaza is a stark reminder of our ongoing struggle for freedom and dignity. Reports have unveiled the extent of suffering endured by the hostages, including accounts of abuse, neglect, and inhumane conditions that defy comprehension. The World Health Organization has urgently called for their immediate release, emphasizing the dire health and humanitarian crisis facing these individuals—among them, fathers, mothers, elderly, and innocent children, with up to 30 of these souls being under the age of 18.Disturbingly, recent disclosures have brought to light the brutal treatment of these hostages. Reports indicate a chilling pattern of sexual violence and physical abuse inflicted upon the captives, tactics of terror that are abhorrent to our collective sense of humanity. Witnesses recount the appalling conditions in which men, women, and children were held—beaten, threatened with death, and kept in cages, some marked to hinder any chance of escape. The plight of these individuals, who are denied basic necessities and medical care, is a horrifying testament to the cruelty they have been subjected to.Amid these stories, the plight of the Bibas family stands out as particularly heart-wrenching. Abducted on October 7, father Yarden, mother Shiri, and their sons Ariel, 4, and baby Kfir, became symbols of the human cost of this conflict. Hamas's claim, through a propaganda video, that Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were killed during an Israeli bombardment adds a layer of anguish, while the separate holding of Yarden highlights the brutal tactics employed to fracture families and communities. IDF Spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari's response underscores a nation's commitment to its people's safe return.\n\nOur response to this crisis, as a community of faith and action, has been unwavering. Vision for Israel has sought to bring these injustices into the light, advocating tirelessly for the release of the hostages. Our efforts extend from the Millennium Center's dedicated space honoring these individuals' stories to vocal advocacy on international platforms, urging for global intervention in this dire humanitarian crisis.This Passover, as we recount the story of God's deliverance of Israel from bondage, let us also reflect on the empty chairs at our Seder tables—symbolizing the absence of those still held captive. This year, we encourage you, our dear partners, to join in leaving an empty chair at your Seder table in honor of the hostages, a poignant reminder of those who cannot be with their families.While we cannot directly contribute to the release of the hostages, we invite you to support the broader work of Vision for Israel. Your support enables us to continue providing aid, promoting awareness, and advocating for those in need. Your partnership is invaluable as we strive to embody the spirit of liberation and compassion that Passover represents.\n\nAs we gather with our families, let us carry the stories of those whose freedom has been stolen. Let their plight move us to action, and let our prayers for their release rise like incense before the Lord.Your support can make a difference. Please consider supporting the work of Vision for Israel HERE.\n\nShalom and blessings for a meaningful Passover,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nEach year, as we reach Tisha B’Av, the 9th of Av on the Jewish calendar (August 3rd this year), we enter a time of deep mourning and reflection. This somber day marks the destruction of not one, but two Holy Temples in Jerusalem, centuries apart. And yet, their tragic falls are bound together by a shared root: Israel’s estrangement from God and the bitter consequences that followed.Tisha B’Av is not just about what happened in ancient times. It is a cry that echoes across generations—even into the devastation of today. In light of the recent conflict and the destruction of homes in Israel during the Israel-Iran war, this day takes on a renewed urgency and relevance. As we mourn what was lost long ago, we are reminded of what still breaks in our world today—and of God’s call to restore and rebuild.\n\nSolomon’s Temple—the First Temple—stood as a symbol of God’s covenant and presence among His people. Built around 957 BCE, it was the center of Jewish worship for nearly four centuries. But by 586 BCE, the kingdom of Judah had turned from God, descending into idolatry, injustice, and corruption.The prophet Jeremiah had warned the people of judgment, but they did not listen. The Babylonians, under King Nebuchadnezzar, besieged the city of Jerusalem. On the 9th of Av, the Temple was destroyed, and the people were exiled to Babylon (2 Kings 25). The sacred vessels were plundered, the walls burned, and what was once a place of divine communion became a pile of rubble and ash.This destruction was more than the loss of a building—it was the breaking of a relationship. Israel had grieved God, and He allowed the consequences to unfold. Yet even in wrath, He remembered mercy.\n\nNearly 70 years later, some of the exiles returned and began to rebuild. The Second Temple was completed in 516 BCE and later expanded under Herod. Though not as glorious as Solomon’s original structure, it once again became the heart of Jewish life.But history repeated itself. Infighting, sectarianism, and rebellion weakened the nation. In 70 CE, Roman legions under Titus laid siege to Jerusalem. After months of starvation and bloodshed, they breached the walls. On the 9th of Av, they set fire to the Temple. Josephus, the Jewish historian, describes flames consuming the Holy Place as thousands perished. The Second Temple was lost—just as the First had been—on the very same date.This loss marked the beginning of nearly 2,000 years of exile and dispersion for the Jewish people. No longer centered in Jerusalem, the nation became scattered among the nations. Yet the promise of return always remained.\n\nTisha B’Av has become a convergence point for Jewish tragedy. Beyond the Temple destructions, other calamities also occurred on or near this date:\n\nThis day holds centuries of sorrow in its shadow. And yet, we do not mourn without hope.\n\nIn June 2025, we witnessed again scenes of destruction—not by foreign empires, but by modern warfare. The recent Israel-Iran war left thousands of families displaced. Homes were flattened. Neighborhoods reduced to dust. The images resemble, heartbreakingly, the ruins of Jerusalem past.Is it any wonder, then, that Tisha B’Av still speaks?When a family in central Israel stands amid the debris of what once was their home, they echo the cries of those who saw the Temple fall. When synagogues are damaged, communities scattered, and children frightened by sirens and explosions, the weight of Tisha B’Av becomes tragically real again.Yet the message of this day is not only about grief. It is about the longing for restoration.\n\nAfter Tisha B’Av, the Jewish calendar moves into seven weeks of consolation, culminating in Rosh Hashanah. From mourning comes hope. From ruins, rebuilding.We are reminded that God’s presence has never departed from His people. The same God who allowed destruction also promises restoration. Through the prophets, He spoke of a day when the Temple would be rebuilt—not only in stone, but in Spirit.In our generation, we are called to be part of that rebuilding. Every time we comfort the broken, help the displaced, or restore dignity to the suffering, we raise up something sacred again.As we witness the destruction left in the wake of war, we are moved anew to act. Vision for Israel is on the ground helping families rebuild—not temples of stone, but homes of hope. With your support, we can continue to distribute food, clothing, and emergency aid. Together, we can answer devastation with compassion.As you reflect on the meaning of Tisha B’Av, please consider making a donation to help rebuild what has been broken. Let us not allow the sorrow of this day to end in silence. Instead, let it become the beginning of healing.\n\nTo learn more, read this blog: Tisha B’Av: Remembering the Loss of Zion\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,You may have heard what happened this past week, but I would like to share my own perspective. Batya and I had a night that we will never forget.A wildfire broke out near our home. It was serious, and could have cost us our lives. As the fire brigade and emergency personnel began to pack up, the fire chief told me that if five more minutes had gone by, our house would have been destroyed. That fact has been haunting me ever since, and inspired me to detail our story for you.We were watching “Twelve Angry Men,” and were nearing the iconic end when Batya said, “Something is burning!” Once she said something, I began to smell the smoke, and it seemed to be entering our house. We quickly walked out the front door and saw a glow and flames just next to our home in the hills of Jerusalem. I ran down to see what was going on and I was the fourth person to arrive on the scene.As we watched, the flames exploded and the sparks and embers flew through the air. Someone brought a bucket of water, but it was useless. The flames engulfed all of the trees and bushes and began to spread. After months of viewing news reports about the fires in the USA, Siberia, Greece and Turkey, I knew that we could easily lose everything. Thankfully for us, our home, and the second home being threatened, housed Jewish believers. God’s angels must have been watching over us.Fortunately, the fire brigade showed up just in time. Though it seemed like forever, they were committed to extinguish the fires and save our homes. Several thoughts went through my mind as we waited for the firefighters to come, and for safety to return.First, of course, we called upon the Body of Messiah for prayer.Then, earthly concerns came to my mind. We were told to evacuate, so I ran back into our home to take what little I could with me in a backpack. I grabbed three laptops, our mobile phones, passports, credit cards and my best acoustic guitar. Then I ran to meet up with Batya. Once I calmed down and caught my breath, I was able to think a little more clearly.The fact is, all the material goods in the world mean very little. They can be gone in an instant. What matters most is human life, our families, and our faith in Him to pull us through the hard times.\n\nNow herein is a great promise. During this tragedy, I thought of the thousands who have lost homes and businesses due to fires. When I meditated on how the Lord protects His children, I had absolute peace. Truthfully, I don’t think I was ever scared. I know that the Lord was with me, and His desires will always prevail. Our Lord protects us, no matter how scared or unsure we may feel. He comes to us in the form of firefighters, helpful neighbors, and prayers from friends. He is always with us, and He always leads the way. This fire is a personal testimony of His grace and power.From the hills of Jerusalem,BarryP.S. For those of you who knew what was happening as it unfolded, thank you for your prayers. They were surely answered.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

I ran down to see what was going on and I was the fourth person to arrive on the scene.<br/><br/>As we watched, the flames exploded and the sparks and embers flew through the air. Someone brought a bucket of water, but it was useless. The flames engulfed all of the trees and bushes and began to spread. After months of viewing news reports about the fires in the USA, Siberia, Greece and Turkey, I knew that we could easily lose everything. Thankfully for us, our home, and the second home being threatened, housed Jewish believers. God’s angels must have been watching over us.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the fire brigade showed up just in time. Though it seemed like forever, they were committed to extinguish the fires and save our homes. Several thoughts went through my mind as we waited for the firefighters to come, and for safety to return.<br/><br/>First, of course, we called upon the Body of Messiah for prayer.<br/><br/>Then, earthly concerns came to my mind. We were told to evacuate, so I ran back into our home to take what little I could with me in a backpack. I grabbed three laptops, our mobile phones, passports, credit cards and my best acoustic guitar. Then I ran to meet up with Batya. Once I calmed down and caught my breath, I was able to think a little more clearly.<br/>The fact is, all the material goods in the world mean very little. They can be gone in an instant. What matters most is human life, our families, and our faith in Him to pull us through the hard times.</p><p>Now herein is a great promise. <br/><br/>During this tragedy, I thought of the thousands who have lost homes and businesses due to fires. When I meditated on how the Lord protects His children, I had absolute peace. Truthfully, I don’t think I was ever scared. I know that the Lord was with me, and His desires will always prevail. Our Lord protects us, no matter how scared or unsure we may feel. He comes to us in the form of firefighters, helpful neighbors, and prayers from friends. He is always with us, and He always leads the way. <br/>This fire is a personal testimony of His grace and power.<br/><br/>From the hills of Jerusalem,<br/>Barry<br/><br/><br/>P.S. For those of you who knew what was happening as it unfolded, thank you for your prayers. They were surely answered.</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,At 6:30 a.m. on October 7, 2023, Yuval Siman Tov looked up from the dancefloor at the Nova festival and saw what he thought were fireworks streaking the sky. The music cut, the DJ’s voice came over the speakers: “Lie down”. For a beat, everyone hoped it was only rockets—that the party would resume, that the morning would return to normal. Then a policeman shouted: “Evacuate—now!”. Chaos swallowed the field. People ran in every direction, tripping over mats and chairs, choking on dust, clutching hands so they wouldn’t be torn apart. Cars jammed the exit like pebbles in a narrow stream, engines screaming, horns blaring, no way out but forward. Yuval and his friends—Tamir at the wheel, and Ron in the back—tried a side road, a thin ribbon through low hills. A police car edged ahead, then slowed. They went around. The officer pounded on his door, shouting over the wind: “terrorists are coming straight at you”. Yuval yelled, ”Turn around!” and as they swung south, the first convoy of terrorists appeared: motorcycles, ATVs, a truck with a mounted machine gun. The air filled with metal. “We bent our heads,” Yuval said, “and the first bullets hit.” Glass burst like shrapnel glitter; hundreds of rounds stitched the car. In the back seat, Ron groaned, clutching his stomach—“Guys, I’m dying.”The shooting paused. Tamir tried to restart the car; the engine wouldn’t start. Hearts fell like stones. They had to run. Yuval spilled from the passenger side, felt the blistering quiet of a second, then the crack of more shots. He saw Ron dying and couldn’t speak. Terrorists turned to fire on the next line of cars; others advanced from the south. Yuval grabbed Tamir’s hand. “Run. Run, run, run.”At last, he dropped into a bush, chest to dirt, face angled toward the asphalt, pretending to be dead. For twenty minutes, he dared not blink. He watched cars crumple and exhale smoke; watched people being dragged from seats and being shot; watched small, final movements stop. One gunman stepped out from the trees and leveled his weapon at Yuval from fifty meters, eyes on Yuval’s stillness—then a voice from the road called him back. The barrel lowered. The footsteps receded.The pain in Yuval’s back found him then, sharp and blooming. He stripped off his sweatshirt—it was soaked in blood. Two holes pocked his shirt near the spine. Dizzy and alone, he thought: if I’m going to die, let me try first to survive. He crawled, then somehow stood, then somehow ran. On an inner road, a jeep appeared. He raised his hands, half-naked and bleeding, turned to show his back. The driver slowed, then rolled on— thinking Yuval was a threat, Yuval thinking the same of him. “Please save me!” Yuval shouted. The driver stepped out, weapon trained, and demanded a name. “I’m Yuval, from Rehovot. Please—save me.” The man circled, checked for a weapon, then opened a door and let Yuval in his car. Shortly after, he pushed Yuval into a roadside safety shelter. The roar outside faded; the loneliness did not.Forty minutes later, rescue arrived—a resident from nearby Moshav Yesha who took Yuval to his home and took him to a safe room. Yuval’s phone lit with a miracle: Tamir calling. “I can’t believe it,” Yuval cried. “You’re alive.” “I can’t believe you’re alive,” Tamir answered. Joy lasted a breath, then grief swallowed it: Ron was gone. As the hours unwound, the questions tightened like wire. Should I have dragged him out? Why him and not me? At Ron’s funeral, Yuval took his father’s hand; the father pulled him into an aching embrace. “It wouldn’t have helped anyone,” he whispered, “if instead of two there were zero.”Guilt tried to take root. Yuval would not let it flower. Even before October 7, he had started a small nonprofit linking youth with elderly Israelis—especially Holocaust survivors—who had been left behind, shut in through long months of COVID, their eyes carrying the weight of being unseen. After the massacre, he leaned closer to them. He sat and listened to stories no one else could bear, delivering essentials and, more than that, time. “We all experienced murder in front of our eyes,” he said. “Hatred and anger. Neglect. We need to stick together.” Serving them steadied him. Their endurance taught him to breathe again.Because friends like you refused to look away, Vision for Israel could come alongside Yuval in the months that followed. Your generosity helped us award him a scholarship to continue his university studies—one step toward the future he nearly lost on that road. It didn’t erase the scars or mend every memory. But it did say: your life matters; your calling remains; your hands can still carry hope to the lonely.If you feel led, please help us lift more survivors and students like Yuval with scholarships, trauma care, and practical support. Give today to Vision for Israel — your gift will help plant new life in scorched places.

It is a time when we recall how the Jewish people were saved from destruction, and how sorrow was turned into gladness. But for thousands of children in Israel today, joy feels like a distant dream.Since October 7, 2023, about 20,000 children have become terror survivors—many suffering from deep trauma, both physical and emotional. 1,873 have been injured, 1,884 have lost parents or siblings, and 23 have been left completely orphaned. These precious children have had their sense of security shattered. Instead of worrying about school and friends, they are learning to cope with grief, fear, and unimaginable loss.One of these children is Ido, an 11-year-old boy from Kibbutz Nachal Oz.On the morning of October 7, Ido and his family woke up to the sound of sirens. They hurried into their safe room, trying to understand what was happening. The sky filled with rockets, explosions shook the house, and soon, they heard shouting in Arabic. Within moments, terrorists had infiltrated their home.Gunfire sprayed through their windows, the electricity was cut, and the family sat in complete darkness. Ido began to panic. His little sisters were thirsty, but there was no water. His parents whispered to each other, trying to figure out what to do. They realized this might be their last day alive.At one point, Ido turned to his mother and whispered, \"Tell me good things.\" A simple request, but one that speaks volumes. In the midst of unimaginable terror, this child just wanted to hear something good.By God’s grace, Ido and his family survived. But the trauma of that day will never leave them. Like thousands of other children across Israel, he now lives with the emotional scars of war.Here at Vision for Israel, we are committed to bringing hope and comfort to children like Ido. That is why we are hosting a special Purim celebration for nearly 350 people: children and their families, survivors of terror attacks, at the Millennium Center. We desire to make these children laugh, play, and experience the joy of Purim. They will enjoy:\n\nThe cost of this event is nearly $27,000, including transportation, all activities, musicians, breakfast, and a freshly cooked lunch. This is your opportunity to be involved, take part, and bless these families. Purim is a time to remember how God turned sorrow into joy and despair into celebration.

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,When we think of Israel’s soldiers, we often picture them standing strong on the front lines, defending our homeland with courage and determination. But what the cameras and headlines rarely show is what happens after the battle—when the uniform comes off, the weapons are put away, and the soldier returns home. For many, the war never truly ends.Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an invisible wound, yet it is as real and devastating as any physical injury. It can trap a soldier in the past, replaying moments of terror and loss, and rob them of peace in the present. It can destroy marriages, isolate friendships, and, tragically, sometimes claim lives.This year, the crisis has become more urgent than ever. The Knesset recently held a special session to address the alarming number of suicides among active-duty and reserve soldiers. Behind every statistic is a story—a son or daughter, a spouse, a friend—someone who once stood guard over Israel and is now fighting a battle in their own mind.One such story is of a young reservist who returned home from an intense combat operation physically unharmed but emotionally shattered. His nights were filled with nightmares. A car backfiring could send him into a panic. His wife, desperate to help, felt herself drifting further away as he withdrew into silence. Only after joining a therapeutic group did he begin to find his voice again—and with it, the first glimmer of hope.We at Vision for Israel believe that no soldier should have to fight this battle alone. That is why, starting this September, we are launching a vital new initiative in partnership with an experienced organization dedicated to helping soldiers with PTSD. Together, we will offer mental rehabilitation sessions at our Millennium Center—safe, confidential spaces where soldiers and their loved ones can begin the journey of healing.These sessions will be structured, compassionate, and deeply personal. Each program will run for 4–8 meetings, two hours each, guided by trained professionals who specialize in trauma recovery. Importantly, soldiers will not walk this road alone—spouses or significant others will be part of the process, learning how to rebuild trust, communicate through pain, and face the future together.Group sizes will be small—only 10–15 participants—ensuring that each person is truly seen and heard. We will adapt special rooms in the Millennium Center to provide warmth, privacy, and comfort, creating an environment where healing can flourish.The cost of launching this entire program—covering trained facilitators, preparation of the spaces, and all materials—is 60,000 Shekels (about USD 16,000). When you think of the lives that can be saved, the families that can be restored, and the futures that can be reclaimed, it is a small price for an immeasurable return.Your support can give a soldier the courage to take that first brave step toward healing. You can help them reclaim nights free from nightmares, rebuild marriages that have been strained to the breaking point, and rediscover the joy of living without fear.We know these men and women have already paid a high price for our nation’s safety. Now, we have the privilege and responsibility to stand with them in their hour of need. Your gift—no matter the size—will help bring light into the darkest of places.Please give generously today at visionforisrael.com/donate so that together, we can be the hands of the Lord to heal the brokenhearted. Let us not turn away from those who once stood in harm’s way for our protection, but instead run toward them with compassion and hope.May we be found faithful in answering the silent cry of Israel’s wounded warriors.With deep gratitude,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nAs we take a look at what God did over these last three months, we are in awe of how many lives were impacted here in Israel. We are so grateful for your ongoing support and prayers that have made all of this possible. Let’s take a look at the faces, places, and people that were touched by your generous hearts!\n\nThe challenging war imposed on Israel on October 7th has impacted everyone, including Vision for Israel. We had to reschedule several planned events, including a musical brunch for Holocaust survivors. The event was postponed and took place at our center. The survivors experienced a morning brimming with music, comfort, and delicious food. We are thankful that amidst the turmoil of war, we were able to provide a time of hope, joy, and strength to each of their hearts, offering a much-needed respite from the stress of the war.\n\nVFI provided support and aid to many families throughout Israel. Some of the distributions included diapers and duvets to families, food baskets, gift cards, diapers to those in need in Jerusalem, and duvets were delivered to the homes of elderly families. The elderly expressed deep gratitude for the warm duvet blankets during these cold days. All the families have thanked us from the bottom of their hearts, and have blessed us in return.\n\nOur team provided many of the elderly people in the city of Holon with winter clothing and warm blankets.\n\nIn the massacre of the October 7th Hamas attack, the Eshkol region endured significant suffering, prompting our commitment to support their defense teams, whose courageous actions saved the lives of many that day. VFI presented a donation of crucial equipment to the security officers of 32 emergency defense teams in the area. Each team received defibrillators, radios, and scanning lights. Despite the profound grief and trauma, the security officers expressed deep gratitude for the substantial contribution and ongoing support.\n\nBarry oversaw the installation of additional safety shelters across Israel. In the North, 40 shelters were strategically placed throughout the Galilee and Golan Region, including in the city of Karmiel. During his visit, Barry also met with the mayor of Karmiel, who conveyed his gratitude to VFI on behalf of the city's residents.In the south, one of the shelters was installed in Kibbutz Re’im, where 364 young people attending the \"Nova\" festival on October 7 tragically lost their lives. Since January, VFI has also installed 16 shelters in various schools across southern cities. To date, VFI has installed a total of 211 shelters since the inception of this project.\n\nThe cities and towns near the northern border have suffered from repeated terror attacks. The head of the local council and the security officer of Yanu’ach Jat, requested emergency equipment for the council's defense team to help guard and protect the residents of the area. Vision for Israel responded by donating 40 ceramic vests, 40 helmets, 5 medic bags, 2 doctor/paramedic bags, 15 scanning lights, and 5 stretchers.Our team delivered the equipment to the head of the local council and enjoyed a special ceremony that honored VFI for the generous donation and support.\n\nThanks to your generous donations, we've been able to provide support to hundreds of families over the past few months. We've distributed essential items like food, blankets, clothing, and gift cards to help meet their needs. Our team has traveled to various cities and towns to ensure that assistance reaches those who need it most. In each location, we've encountered families facing significant challenges in putting food on the table. Your contributions are truly making a difference, having an immense impact on the lives of many people here in Israel.\n\nThe reserve unit was mobilized to protect, guard, and thwart terrorist activities in Jerusalem and the surrounding area during the Iron Swords War. Up until now, they have been wearing bulky storm suits for the winter. One company sent VFI a request for better winter gear, and we were happy to respond by providing them with jackets and ceramic vests to equip them with the proper gear. The coats are light and adaptable to weather, and the vests are smaller, easy to carry, and provide a high level of protection.\n\nOur dedicated team members distributed food baskets, fleece blankets, and gift cards to welfare families across Israel. Meeting these families face to face and providing practical support ahead of Passover filled our hearts with warmth. Their gratitude and blessings for the founders, donors, and our Vision for Israel team were deeply appreciated. Wishing each family a joyous Passover celebration this year!\n\nA new ambulance was donated to MDA. The ambulance was dedicated in honor of the October 7th victims and is serving the Ramle population. We held a special ceremony at the Millennium Center and invited the veterans of Modi’in to celebrate this joyful event. This is the 6th ambulance that VFI has donated, and the 7th is on the way!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

From the very first days of Vision for Israel in 1994, one of core focuses in giving aid to the people of Israel was the support we offer to victims of terror attacks. As these acts of hatred have increased in recent months, our desire to provide aid and support to people and families broken by such evil has also increased.\n\n“Comfort, yes, comfort My people!” Says your God. “Speak comfort to Jerusalem, and cry out to her, that her warfare is ended... — Isaiah 40:1-2\n\nThere have been over 2,200 attacks in Israel and Judea and Samaria this year alone. The number of innocents killed has reached a gruesome high since 2008. These numbers are tragic, and we pray for those victims and their families. These statistics are tragic, but they are so much more than statistics—they represent mothers, fathers, even innocent, young children. Vision for Israel prays for the victims and their families. Our goal has always been to offer comfort to the broken-hearted and embrace these widows and orphans. We encourage all our partners to join us in praying for peace in Jerusalem and Israel... but prayers for protection from violence are only the first step. The number of victims and families who suffer as a result of these attacks continues to grow. We are a nation of families and relatives who are weeping and mourning for the great loss of life of so many. But we must continue our mission of building lives up, even when terrorists are calling for destruction and death.Vision For Israel is as committed as ever to our mission of supporting victims of terror in every way we can. They deserve to heal with dignity and resume daily life. Please consider giving to those who have been victimized by this wave of violence plaguing Israel. We can aid in giving them their lives back.Join us in this vital mission by donating here.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear friends,Our purpose at Vision for Israel is vast. We aim to help our neighbors in many ways and ensure that our communities have what they need. Perhaps the most significant way that we help our communities is by acting as stewards between donors and recipients. This service is key to giving. Many people feel shame when they receive charity, while others feel proud and egotistical when they give. Our job is to facilitate a shame-free, modest exchange of aid. It is in this way that we best serve God.This idea brought about a moving story I (Batya) once heard.Yosef's father had a neighborhood grocery store. He would make fresh yogurt to sell, and needed dozens of glass jars to put his yogurt in. Every day a man would come around selling jars, and Yosef's father would always buy from him, always making sure to pay a fair price.One day, Yosef saw that the seller was walking up and down the street, collecting jars and putting them in his basket. This was the same basket of jars that he would bring to Yosef’s father to buy.Yosef was so upset when he saw this, and said to his father, \"I saw him pick up jars on the street and sell them to you.\" Yosef’s father silenced him and said, “Quiet, not now. Don’t speak\". And Yosef went on to say, \"But Abba (father) he is selling you something he found on the street.\"When there were no people in the grocery store, Yosef’s father said to him, “My son, do not shame a man for his actions in public. He is doing what he can to survive, and this is how he makes his income. Everything is fine. I know where the jars come from, and I gladly give him the money. Never embarrass a person in front of others.”The Jewish principle of Matan Baseter (giving in secret) fits this story perfectly. The Sephardic Jewish philosopher, Maimonides, is famous for articulating eight distinctive levels of charitable giving. Giving anonymously occupies a high position; the second level of giving is \"where the donor doesn't know to whom he gives and the recipient doesn't know from whom he receives\". The key to true, heartfelt giving is modesty. It’s important to be humble, and give of yourself without wanting praise or attention in return; we must do good for the sake of serving God and our communities. The second, and perhaps most important part of serving others, is ensuring that those you serve don’t feel embarrassed or subordinate.Here at Vision for Israel, we facilitate Matan Baseter for our donors and communities. We act as the conduit for double-blind giving. You, our donors, are able to give freely and modestly, while our recipients don’t feel ashamed or embarrassed of their poverty.God loves all his people equally. When you take the time to give modestly, you participate in Matan Baseter. The Bible says:\n\nOur status in life does not matter in the eyes of God. Remember this when you perform acts of service, and help those in need. As we say at Vision for Israel, all are equal, and all deserve dignity and respect. To give anonymously and participate in the Matan Baseter that we administrate, we have many opportunities to do so. You may find them here. May the Lord bless and keep you as you serve the needy.Your friends,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

It's a time when generosity can be a beacon of hope for families who have lost the comfort of their homes and the assurance of safety.Vision for Israel has been steadfast in its mission, reaching out to hundreds of displaced families now residing in hotels across central Israel, providing not just the necessities of clothing and food but also the solace of toys and games for their children.For those who remain in the southern cities, the echoes of conflict are still close. Our teams, often under the threat of rocket fire, persist in delivering food baskets to cities like Ashdod, Sderot, Netivot, and Ofakim. These acts of bravery and kindness are rays of light in these shadowed times.But the need is ongoing, and the path to recovery is long. Barry has visited places scarred by the conflict, like Kibbutz Be'eri, and the images he brings back are harrowing. They are a testament to the severity of the conflict and the urgent need for continued support.This Giving Tuesday, let your compassion flow towards those who need it most. Your donation can provide a displaced family with the warmth of a meal, the comfort of clothing, or the joy of a child's smile amidst uncertainty.We're channeling our efforts into a special initiative: providing financial aid to families whose homes and belongings have been ravaged by conflict. Each family will receive $2,500 to replace furniture and appliances, helping to restore normalcy to their lives. Our immediate goal is to extend this lifeline to 50 families, with the hope of reaching more as funds allow.As we move forward, let us carry the heart of giving not just today but every day, ensuring that those affected by the war find not just relief but also the strength to rebuild.\n\nWith heartfelt appreciation,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nWe are excited to share this great report of what God has been doing in these last three months here in Israel through your generosity and support of the work of VFI. From donating shelters to helping Holocaust Survivors, God has been impacting this nation greatly and we feel honored to be a part of what He is doing! We have had a lot of work to do these last months, and God was faithful to send us extra helpers and volunteers to complete the packaging and distribution of the donations. We are also incredibly grateful for each of you who faithfully gave to VFI so that we could have the funds to provide specific needs for the people of Israel.\n\nVision for Israel has taken swift action in the recent rocket attack, during Operation Sheild and Arrow, by providing an additional 38 mobile bomb shelters to the southern region of Israel under rocket fire and sirens sounding. Since the beginning of the project, we have successfully installed 155 shelters.\n\nAt Vision for Israel, we are committed to showing love and care to precious Holocaust survivors and refugees. With your help, we can provide warm blankets, food baskets, gift cards, and home visits to positively affect their lives. We also host joyful events to give them back their sense of belonging and enjoyment of life.\n\nRecently, we were blessed with kind offers from a thoughtful IDF officer who offered to send soldiers to volunteer at the Millennium Center.We were moved by their selflessness to help us sort clothing and prepare care packages filled with hygiene products for both Holocaust survivors and new immigrants. It was truly inspiring to witness these young individuals, who come from challenging economic situations, devote their time and effort to assisting others.This event was particularly special because it took place only a few days after Holocaust Remembrance Day and close to Memorial and Independence Day. We are grateful for their kind hearts and dedication to making a difference in the lives of others.\n\nTo reach as many needy people as possible, we create relationships and collaborations with various organizations. We recently made contact with an association working for the welfare of Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem, whose chairman and founder is himself a Holocaust survivor from the Soviet Union. The chairman noticed that almost no assistance is given to Holocaust survivors from the Soviet Union who arrived in Israel at a somewhat late age and do not speak the language. He felt the need to make their voice heard, and although he doesn't speak the language either, he founded the association in 2019 together with his daughter.Vision for Israel joined the task and our team held a special event, bazaar-style for dozens of Holocaust survivors living in Jerusalem. We brought clothing for them to choose from and each survivor also received a gift package, including a set of bedding, a body towel, and a personal blanket. The elderly were so happy that they blessed VFI and thanked us.\n\nWe were happy and excited to extend our assistance to the needy for the first time in the city of Gedera. We brought food baskets to dozens of families in need, who thanked us from the bottom of their hearts for the generous donations. They were also interested in Vision for Israel and asked to hear about our activities. Some of them also asked for our phone number, so they could pass it on to other families who could use our help.\n\nVision for Israel has made genuine friends around the globe since its inception. Recently, VFI received a visit from friends in China who came from afar. This visit was an uplifting experience, especially because our small country is facing numerous challenges at this time. It was heartening to hear them express their support for the State of Israel. We extend our gratitude to the organizers who thought of us and helped us assist and impact numerous families.\n\nVision for Israel has been supporting a special needs school in Jerusalem for many years. The school has about 80 students studying in grades 1-6. The school operates a therapeutic kitchen for students to learn how to cook, bake and set the table. The kitchen is equipped with tools and appliances. Recently, the glass of their old oven was accidentally broken and the oven itself was no longer working well. Therefore, they urgently needed an oven to continue their learning program. In addition, the school needed a microwave in the kitchen. VFI was delighted to purchase the needed oven and microwave to support the students in their learning.\n\nIn a first for VFI, we've distributed baskets of fresh produce alongside hygiene products and dry food items to 60 families in need in Gedera. Our dedicated staff, Assaf and Yoni, aided by the welfare staff, ensured each family received lettuce, eggplants, bell peppers, and more. The families were thrilled with our initiative, grateful for the generosity, and eager to learn more about VFI. Their gratitude truly warmed our hearts and strengthened our commitment to providing healthy vegetable baskets alongside our regular support.\n\nWe give God all the glory and honor for how He has faithfully met the needs of His people and our nation!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,\n\nThere are exactly 30 days from Purim to Passover, and these two holidays have always held a special relationship.\n\nWe commemorate Purim by reading the Megillah—telling the story of an anonymous orphan who became the queen of Persia. It’s the story of an attempt to exterminate a whole people—perpetrated by a hater of the Jewish people, who was serving as the king's advisor.\n\nWe commemorate Passover by reading the Passover Haggadah—telling the story of Exodus, and how the Jewish people went from being slaves in Egypt—rejected and humiliated—to become God’s chosen people.\n\nPresently, we live in a time of bondage—a dark night of the soul.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear friends,Amid war, peace is one of the hardest things to find. On October 7, 2023, the nation of Israel was shaken to the core and lost all peace, when the enemy invaded from Gaza and massacred our citizens. The evil enemy made it their goal to murder babies, children, the elderly, women, and all the citizens who were sleeping in their beds early on a Shabbat morning. This Shabbat was also a holiday — Simchat Torah. It is normally a day of rejoicing, yet instead, the enemy swept in and made it one of the worst days in the history of this nation. These wicked people murdered, butchered, decapitated bodies and limbs, burned babies in ovens, and stole from houses. 1,144 people in Israel were murdered, most of them civilians, and 243 were taken as hostages. And thousands more were injured. We, the citizens, have become the main targets in the enemy's war against us. Pain, suffering, and heavy grief were laid on the shoulders of our people that day. So, in the midst of all of this, how in the world do we find peace? How can we find hope and faith in such chaos and evil? The only place we can find true and deep peace is in Yeshua. He is the only one who can help guard our hearts and our minds by giving us a peace that surpasses all understanding. In the book of John, Yeshua says:\n\n“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.” - John 14:27\n\nAll of these horrible things bring me (Batya) to a place of searching for justice, especially in the areas of social and personal security for the citizens living in the \"promised\" land. Today, Israelis are looking for promises in the scriptures about the long-awaited days of peace for our people. From the day the state of Israel was established in 1948, we have been at war for our existence and have had battles against terrorism almost daily. Yet, we still believed in signing peace agreements with the Arab countries around us and thought we had entered a new era of ‘peace’. But instead, we find the small state of Israel once again being attacked by enemies around us.Since the war began, the Israeli people have been bombarded with daily updates and news about what is happening to their beloved people and our land. All of this horrible news has stolen our peace. Many are disturbed by their thoughts, horrific images they have seen, overwhelming fear, worry about hostages and loved ones, and many other heartbreaking aspects of this tragedy. Our lives here in Israel have been turned upside down, and we don’t know when this war will end. We all feel the pain, grief, and bereavement. And we ask, ‘Why are we doomed to go through another Holocaust?’ ‘How do we keep our minds at peace during war?’ ‘How do we maintain a balance between the harsh reality and a healthy inner peace for our soul?’ One of the ways for us to fight fear and worry is by accepting the word of God and His promises to us.\n\n“Say to those who are fearful-hearted,\n\nBe strong, do not fear!\n\nBehold, your God will come with vengeance,\n\nWith the recompense of God;\n\nHe will come and save you.” — Isaiah 35:4\n\nThe best thing we can do is to read the scriptures, pray, and fix our eyes on the Lord. God intended for us to have a relationship with Him. When we focus on His word our eyes are fixed on Him and not on ourselves. The word of God can redirect our thoughts towards the Lord, instead of being focused on the world and ourselves or overwhelmed by this horrific war.\n\nThus says Adonai:\n\n“The people surviving the sword\n\nfound grace in the wilderness—\n\nwhere I gave Israel rest.”\n\n“From afar Adonai appeared to me.”\n\n“Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love.\n\nTherefore I have drawn you with lovingkindness. Again I will build you,\n\nso you will be rebuilt, virgin Israel!\n\nAgain you will take up your tambourines as ornaments,\n\nand go out to dances of merrymakers.\" - Jeremiah 31:1-3\n\nWith enemies on all of Israel’s borders and others rising all around the world, Israel needs hope now more than ever.As believers, the only true way to overcome hopelessness is to stand firm in Yeshua. He is our hope and light no matter what we go through. The prophecies in the Bible remind us that the Messiah will redeem and save us. And it is only with the power of the Holy Spirit who resides in us, that we can stand firm in this truth during the war.God’s promises are eternal and unchanging. Three thousand years ago, God promised this land to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and it still belongs to the Lord and His chosen people. And yet, this promise is being challenged by the enemy and many others believing lies about God and His covenant with Israel. Before the war, there was such a great divide among the people here in Israel. There were terrible demonstrations about legal reform that led to the unstable security situations on the borders of our nation. However, since October 7th, there has been a strong unity and a great change in the hearts of the people. We can see the people of Israel supporting one another, comforting one another, and crying together. So many social initiatives, open hearts, giving to those who need help, and speaking about unity to bring peace to one another as the war rages on. The enemy came to destroy us, but the Lord will restore, rebuild, and revive us! Pray with us that the people of Israel will find peace and hope amid war having the assurance of His salvation and everlasting love.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,As Thanksgiving approaches across the United States, we pause to remember that gratitude is more than a feeling—it’s a way of life that overflows into courageous love for our neighbors. In a world jolted by conflict and confusion, thankful hearts become faithful hands. We worship the Lord for His steadfast love, and then we step forward to reflect that love, especially toward the Jewish people who today often face hostility simply for being who they are—Jewish.In recent seasons, headlines have told a sobering story: synagogues defaced with hateful symbols in Europe; Jewish students harassed on university campuses in the US; families intimidated on public transport for wearing a Kippah or Star of David; kosher shops vandalized; and online incitement spilling into threats and violence. These reports grieve us—not only because they target the Jewish community, but because they strike at the heart of human dignity. Antisemitism is an old hatred wearing new clothes, and it demands a clear, compassionate response from those who love truth.How can we, as followers of Yeshua, push back against this darkness? We begin in prayer—standing on God’s promises and interceding for protection, peace, and wisdom. We speak truth in love, gently but firmly correcting falsehoods when we hear them. We show up—checking in on Jewish friends and neighbors, ensuring they feel seen and safe. We advocate—asking leaders, schools, and local councils to protect vulnerable communities. We learn and teach—sharing Scripture and facts, helping others understand Israel’s story and the Jewish people’s ongoing resilience. And we give to works of compassion that turn love into tangible help.One way your gratitude can become a life-saving action is through ambulances that serve communities across Israel. By God’s grace—and because of friends like you—Vision for Israel has now donated 16 emergency vehicles to Magen David Adom. Most recently, we were honored to present a new, one-of-a-kind MICU (Mobile Intensive Care Unit) ambulance. This unique unit is built for mass-casualty response and can treat two people at the same time rather than one, doubling critical care when minutes mean everything.These ambulances carry advanced medical technology and trained teams who bring calm into chaos—first on the scene after terror attacks, traffic collisions, or sudden medical crises. Sirens wail, doors open, and hope steps out. In those urgent moments, your generosity is present in every oxygen tank, monitor, stretcher, and expertly trained medic. You are there—in the neighborhood, at the roadside, beside the frightened mother, the wounded soldier, the elderly neighbor—whispering, “You’re not alone.”This Thanksgiving season, would you let gratitude move you again—from prayer to action? Your gift today equips first responders, strengthens communities, and stands against the spirit of antisemitism with visible compassion. Together, we can keep these ambulances fueled, maintained, and ready to save lives—so that fear is met, again and again, by love on wheels. Please give now.Todah rabah for your faithfulness, your prayers, and your sacrificial support. May your Thanksgiving table be filled with joy, and may the Lord multiply your kindness. With deep gratitude,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe average age of the 192,000 or so Holocaust survivors currently living in Israel is 85 years. Survivors tend to have unique problems that accompany them throughout their lives, intensifying over the years: health problems, psychological distress, anxieties, unbearable loneliness, and lack of family and social support that would have sweetened their difficult lives at an advanced age.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nHanukkah, also known as the Festival of Lights, is a precious and heartwarming national holiday.For eight days on the 25th day of Kislev (according to the Hebrew calendar), families and friends light up the candles of the Hanukkiah - a nine-branched candelabrum which is traditionally placed on the windowsill so passersby can see it, or outside of one's gate.A popular, family-oriented activity many enjoy is walking around the old neighborhood of Jerusalem and observing the lighting of the Hanukkah candles. What a sight to see the different and creative Hanukkiahs displayed on windows and outside the doors on the street in special wind-resistant glass boxes.Although Hanukkah is not a biblical holiday, it is still observed by religious and secular Jews and is a great cultural opportunity for parties and celebrations as it brings much joy and warmth to the country during the cold and rainy winter season.Families and friends light the candles together, sing traditional songs, eat sufganiyot (a round, deep-fried, jelly-filled doughnut) and other oil-based foods, spin dreidels, and play games.Hanukkah is a joyous holiday whose origin story is one of a gruesome war, a valiant and impossible victory, and the miracle of the cruse of oil.\n\nHanukkah commemorates the recovery of Jerusalem and the subsequent rededication of the Second Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.With the reign of Antiochus IV, Jews were prohibited from practicing Judaism and were commanded to worship Greek gods.When Antiochus IV invaded Jerusalem (168 BCE), killing thousands of Jews and erecting an altar for Zeus in the Holy Temple, a small group of Jews, known as Hasmoneans or Maccabees, revolted zealously to regain control of the Temple and Jerusalem.After two years of warfare, they pushed out the Greek army - whose forces were much more powerful and well-equipped than theirs, as God almighty was on their side.After gaining control of the holy city of Jerusalem, the Jews found the desecrated Temple ransacked and destroyed.Bit by bit and with great care, they rededicated the Temple to the Lord, with one of the Temple's daily rituals being the Menorah which was commanded to burn continuously before the Lord always:\n\n\"Command the Israelites to bring you clear oil of pressed olives for the light so that the lamps may be kept burning. In the tent of meeting, outside the curtain that shields the ark of the covenant law, Aaron and his sons are to keep the lamps burning before the Lord from evening till morning. This is to be a lasting ordinance among the Israelites for the generations to come.\" - Exodus 27:20-21\n\nAs the story goes, there remained only one cruse of oil which had not been defiled, containing enough oil to last only one night.Yet, miraculously the one cruse of oil continued to provide oil lasting for eight nights, a sign of God's providence in the midst of darkness.To this day, the Macabee's revolt is remembered by millions of Jews all over the world as an example of courage in the face of grave opposition.\n\nThe enemies of Israel were intimidating, using fear tactics to coerce them to serve other gods and forget their Jewish identity together with their calling to serve the one true God of Israel.The Maccabees could have retreated back into the long shadows of intimidation cast by their oppressors, and yet they chose to advance upon darkness, armed with the truth, and reclaimed their rightful place in the presence of God in the Temple.Unfortunately, the world we live in today offers us plenty of reasons to be anxious and intimidated. Wars and politics, inflation and sickness, ungodly morals plaguing the innocent, and a pandemic of the fear of men - are all looming in the background of our minds, stealing away our joy.All this would leave us hopeless unless we put our hope and trust in God Almighty to fight our battles and give us strength to resist the enemy.Yeshua commanded us to be a light to the world, understanding our place as sons and daughters of God, and giving us the confidence to face our daily fears head-on.He not only commanded us to be bold for our own sake, shining forth His light but also for those who are locked in the chains of doubt:\n\n\"You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.\" - Matthew 5:14-16\n\nWith Him, victory is guaranteed because Yeshua sits at the right hand of the Father - King over those who oppose Him and those who surrender with a humble heart.The Temple is a symbol of our body, mind, and soul, which often becomes contaminated by the world and its ungodly ways, and the zealousness of the Maccabees is an example of how we should fight fear and rededicate our lives to God in holiness and purity of heart.The Hanukkah story is a great reminder of how even though fear is great, the light of God in us is much greater and can defeat the darkness.\n\nA traditional song sung during Hanukkah is called 'Banu Hoshech Legaresh', which means: we have come to banish the darkness.It is sung around the luminous candles of the Hanukkiah, declaring we have come to banish the darkness with light and fire and that even though each of our lights illuminates little, together, we make a great light.The last lyrics of the song are sung even more aloud as we command the darkness to flee from us (the light), singing it twice as it grows stronger in our hearts.So how can we combat fear and darkness in our own lives? Especially when it seems like the darkness is so much greater than us.By carrying the light of Yeshua in our hearts, a light so great it has the authority to banish the darkness and gives us strength to encounter any enemy standing in our way:\n\n\"When Yeshua spoke again to the people, he said, \"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\" - John 8:12\n\nNot only is Yeshua the light of the world, but he gave us the privilege of being a shining beacon of hope to all those in need of courage.As we enter into the Hanukkah season, let us remember that with each day of Hanukkah, as we add a candle to the Hanukkiah, the light grows and becomes stronger, just as we do when we rely on the Creator, who, with His words declared light into the world.From Barry and Batya and the Vision for Israel team, we pray your hearts be illuminated with God's joy, peace, and pleasant memories with your loved ones this Hanukkah season.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friend,As we approach Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights, our hearts are heavy yet hopeful. This festival's profound message — the triumph of light over darkness, hope over despair — is especially poignant in the face of the ongoing conflict in Israel. Now more than ever, the story of Hanukkah resonates deeply, reminding us of the strength found in unity and faith during times of overwhelming challenge.One such story of resilience and bravery is that of Golan and his family. Amidst the chaos of war, Golan's home in Sderot became a battleground. Terrorists pounded on his door, seeking to inflict harm. Within his kitchen, Golan stood protectively, his family huddled in a secure room, as the sounds of warfare echoed through their home. The terrifying ordeal lasted 25 harrowing hours, during which Golan's quick thinking and the intervention of the IDF kept his family safe, though surrounded by danger.The ordeal began on a seemingly ordinary Shabbat morning, disrupted by relentless rocket fire, shooting, and chaos. Golan witnessed unbearable scenes: a policewoman was murdered in front of his eyes, neighbors and friends in distress, and his city under attack. As the terrorists tried to force their way into his home, Golan fortified the door with furniture, ready to defend his loved ones at all costs.A fierce gun battle erupted in the stairwell of his building, bullets ripping through his home. Amidst the deafening noise, Golan crouched in his kitchen, gripping a makeshift weapon, determined to protect his family. The invaders were eventually repelled by the brave actions of the IDF, but the scars of that day remain.In the aftermath, Golan's family was escorted out of their home, past the grim reminders of the battle. Despite the trauma, Golan's resilience shines as a beacon of hope and courage. He, like many others, embodies the spirit of Hanukkah, a festival that celebrates the miraculous endurance and unyielding spirit of the Jewish people.Such experiences leave deep scars, both physical and emotional. It's in these moments of darkness that your support becomes their light. Vision for Israel has been tirelessly working to assist families like Golan's, providing not just physical necessities but also emotional support to help them recover from such traumatic experiences. We've been on the ground, amidst rocket fire, delivering essentials to those in the most affected areas, ensuring they're not alone in their time of need.As we light the Hanukkah candles, let us remember the resilience of families like Golan's. Their stories inspire us to stand together in solidarity, offering support and hope.\n\nFor a deeper understanding of Hanukkah's enduring message, we invite you to watch this special video, which offers valuable insights through poignant text and imagery.\n\nLet each candle we light this Hanukkah symbolize our solidarity with those facing adversity in Israel. Let's illuminate their path forward with acts of kindness and support, making this festival a beacon of hope for those in need.Chag Urim Sameach (Happy Festival of Lights),Barry & Batyaand the VFI team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Through our efforts, 1500 families received gift cards for the holidays, helping them enjoy a festive season without worry.Yet our compassion extends beyond our local community. We've provided thousands of first-grade children, including those of refugees and asylum seekers in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, with backpacks for the new school year. Over one hundred children received new backpacks, through our collaboration with Mesila, a unique welfare unit in Tel Aviv designated to help refugees and asylum seekers in Israel, and the Jerusalem welfare department.The stories we heard of the asylum seekers are truly heart-wrenching. One of them is R., a single mother from Eritrea and a victim of human trafficking. Her son will start the school year with a new school bag, thanks to your generosity.In a thank you letter that we received, the Mesila rep pointed out the great kindness, professionalism, and compassion of the VFI team both during the initial connection and during the distribution itself.

This year, as we commemorate the birth of our nation, we also turn our thoughts and prayers towards the young souls who have faced the unthinkable horrors of terror, particularly those scarred by the tragic events of October 7th.In the wake of these harrowing events, Vision for Israel is spearheading an initiative that seeks not only to commemorate but to actively support our most vulnerable survivors: the children and youth who have witnessed acts of terror that no eye should see. Our commitment is unwavering, especially towards the therapeutic needs of these young individuals, through our Terror Survivors project.Nestled in the heart of our beloved land, VFI’s Millennium Center stands as a testament to our dedication. Designed to be a haven for healing, it is here that we propose to hold therapeutic sessions aimed at mending young, shattered spirits. In collaboration with seasoned Israeli therapists and psychologists, we are poised to offer specialized care to those who have lived through nightmares.Among the stories that have touched us deeply is that of Dorin’s family, whose normal morning turned into a day of terror when their home was attacked. As Dorin recounts the siege, where \"terrorists shot the door and windows, breaking into the house,\" we are reminded of the stark reality that our children face. Hidden beneath a blanket in a safe room, Dorin's children experienced fear that no child should know. The aftermath is a family grappling with trauma: children afraid to sleep, haunted by the memory of friends and loved ones lost to senseless violence.Dorin's narrative is but one of many. Dalit speaks of the moment her eldest son, on his birthday, whispered, \"Mom, I don’t want to die on my birthday.\" These words echo the unimaginable fear that our children have endured, underscoring the vital importance of our therapeutic initiative.Today, as we reach out to you, our global family, we do so with a plea: to join hands with us in bringing solace and healing to these young hearts. Your support can pave the way for transformative healing sessions, crafting a sanctuary where children can process their trauma, find peace, and rediscover childhood.As we celebrate Israel's independence, let us also embrace the responsibility to foster resilience and healing among our nation's youth. Your generosity can light the path to recovery for many, offering them a future defined not by fear, but by strength and peace.Amid the celebrations, we also remember the thousands of our beloved soldiers who gave their lives in ongoing battles, terror attacks, and wars. May their memory be blessed.We invite you to make a difference today by giving at our donate page and dedicating your donation to Aid to the Poor. Together, we can turn trauma into triumph, ensuring that our children's stories are marked by healing and hope.\n\nHappy Yom Ha’atzma’ut as we honor Israel's 76th year of resilience and freedom!Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

These humble heroes braved death, brutal winters, and unspeakable hardships to find refuge in the land of Israel. Today, we have the opportunity to honor their sacrifices and offer our support in their time of need.It is vital that we remember the history of these Holocaust survivors and refugees, as their stories are a testament to God’s faithfulness to His people and honor their strength and heroism. The State of Israel was founded on their backs, and with the remains of their strength, they courageously built homes, institutions, and the foundations of our country. They fought for Israel’s protection and growth, all for the coming generations to live here in peace and abundance.Despite their incredible resilience and contributions to the Jewish state, many Holocaust survivors and refugees in Israel face significant challenges in their daily lives. The stipend they receive from the state is often not enough to cover their monthly expenses, leaving them with empty refrigerators and a lack of basic necessities. During the cold winters, they struggle to keep warm without adequate heating. Many also experience crippling loneliness and a feeling of neglect and abandonment, as not everyone has family or friends to rely on.Rosain is a Holocaust survivor who has faced countless challenges throughout her life. Rosian Zerner was born in 1935 in Lithuania. When Germany invaded Lithuania in 1941, Rosian and her family were confined to the Kovno Ghetto. When she was six years old, her parents helped her escape through a hole they had dug under the ghetto fence, where she was met by her father's secretary. She was hidden by several rescuers over the next three years before being liberated by the Soviet troops in 1944.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIt has been 30 wonderful and challenging years of leading Vision for Israel.The Iron Swords War came upon us by complete surprise, and the enemy succeeded in penetrating Israel by harming innocent civilians — a cruel and brutal massacre like no other. However, in this war story, we are encouraged by all of our amazing heroes.We all know that you cannot defeat the enemy without courage and heroes. We have heard heroic stories of men and women who have laid down their lives to fight, protect, and save the lives of many. There are many stories of heroism, and we want to recognize and honor a few special heroes we know. Our heroes are the staff members at VFI, who readily extended help and assistance wherever they could throughout this war. It was a beautiful phenomenon, not only among our staff but also among the people of Israel, unifying together to help one another. This is also what it was like for Israel after the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War.One special hero I want to honor is my husband and co-founder of VFI, Barry. He is such a hard worker and goes to every placement of the safety shelters. He travels throughout the nation of Israel, to areas of conflict, right on the borderlines, and endures all kinds of weather conditions and rocket fire to ensure these shelters are placed to protect the people of Israel!And now VFI wants to take a moment to honor another wonderful hero — YOU! When the war began, we saw a wave of financial donations flowing in from you and many others. Before we even had a chance to ask, you generously gave to VFI, so we could help the people here in this time of crisis. In faith, we were donating large amounts of aid that we hadn't raised yet. And by faith, you generously gave, and we witnessed God do amazing miracles of providing for His people through your enormous support.In December 2023, we had to approve a budget for 2024. As I spoke with the CPA and accounting department, I explained that in light of the war, we wanted to help as much as possible. So, I presented a budget that was three times the amount of the budget of the previous year. Today, three months later, the distribution of donations is already fourfold!At the beginning of March, we planned to purchase gift cards for Passover and we had an increase in the number of families in need. Then we received a request to help an additional 200 evacuee families. During the conversation with the applicant, we had to decide if we would increase the budget or not. Even though we hadn’t raised the funds for it yet, we had peace from the Lord to commit to helping all of these families for Passover.Just one hour later I received a text from a local donor asking, \"Do you have a special project to help evacuees from the south?\" I said, \"Of course, we are preparing for Passover right now!\" They said, \"We have a large donation for the evacuees, and we will transfer the donation to you immediately.\" Before we even asked anyone, God already put it on the hearts of His people to provide financially for this need! What a wonderful thing to see the hand of God working through the body of Yeshua to take care of His people!This is the beauty that is in you, dear friends. Today, three months into the year, our outgoing donations have already increased wonderfully, so that we can be a blessing to this nation and tangibly show them the love of God.We are so grateful for you dear friends and heroes!Love,Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nHolocaust Remembrance Day (Yom Hasho’a in Hebrew) commemorates the genocide of six million European Jews at the hands of Nazi Germany between 1941 and 1945 and is commemorated one week after Passover.In Israel, a siren is sounded on this day throughout the country in memory of those who lost their lives. Cars stop in the middle of the highway, and bypassers stand still in solidarity so that the world will never forget or repeat the horrors of the Holocaust. Today, there are nearly seven million Jews who live in Israel. After World War II, many Holocaust survivors made Aliyah (immigrated) from Europe. With broken but hopeful spirits, they risked the dangerous journey through the Mediterranean Sea by ships to the shores of Israel as pioneers, rebuilding Israel as their new home. Even then, many ships were returned to Europe or refugee camps in Cyprus since Israel was under the British mandate.Some might wonder why so many Jews stayed in Europe during the rise of the Nazi regime in 1933? And why, knowing persecution was imminent, did they not flee to Israel?\n\nThe Jews of Europe were stuck between a rock and a hard place, and the reality was much more dangerous and complex than one might assume. With the growing popularity of the Nazi party and the rapid increase of antisemitic crimes, the Jews in Germany feared for their safety. Although all would agree that their circumstances were dire, no one could have predicted the unimaginable terrors that lay ahead.As racial tension and pressure in Germany began to mount, more than 90,000 German and Austrian Jews fled between 1933 and 1939 to neighboring countries such as France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, and Switzerland. For the most part, these countries opened their doors to fleeing Jews and brave gentiles hid Jews in their basements, attics, floors, and closets. In the aftermath of the Kristallnacht pogroms (pogroms against the Jews carried out by the Nazi party) on the 9th-10th of November 1938, more than 100 Jews were murdered, and 30,000 Jewish men were imprisoned in concentration camps. Thousands of Jews attempted to flee the very next day. With Germany stripping German Jews of their German citizenship in 1935, immigrating to different countries became near impossible without proper documentation.Spain permitted entry to almost 30,000 Jewish refugees, primarily from 1939 to 1941. Approximately 300,000 Polish Jews, nearly 10% of the Polish Jewish population, fled German-occupied areas of Poland and crossed into the Soviet zone between 1939 and 1941.Tens of thousands were deported to Siberia, Central Asia, and other remote areas. After the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, more than a million Soviet Jews fled eastward into the Asian parts of the country. Countries such as France, Belgium, and the Netherlands took in 30,000 each, and the United States accepted 102,000, the most of all countries.\n\nAlthough many Jews did make it to other countries, many were turned away at the border, and some who came by ship were not even allowed to dock. Imagine arriving at the border of a country that might be your only hope of survival, only to be turned back, doomed to almost certain death.Jews looking for safety did not initially set their hopes on returning to Israel as one would expect. Israel, then ruled by Britain, took in 55,000 but limited the number of refugees they were willing to accept. In Europe, although close to 30,000 Jews were accepted into Switzerland, approximately 20,000 were turned away at the Swiss border.The famous St. Louis ship carried 937 Jews seeking refuge in Havana, Cuba, but only 28 were allowed to disembark. The ship then tried its chances with the United States and Canada with no success, finally returning to Europe to disperse the people between the countries. At a certain point, escape became near impossible after the war began on September 1, 1939. With lack of funds, burdensome immigration bureaucracies, and lack of efficient communication or transportation - families were trapped and forced to watch as evil approached.What transpired after these events was a nightmare no one could have foreseen. Millions of Jews were taken to ghettos, concentration camps, and death camps scattered on European grounds. The option of escaping was only by death.\n\nUnfortunately, the world is nowhere near done with wars and persecution. Yeshua warns us that the end of days holds many challenges:\"You will hear of wars and rumors of wars, but see to it that you are not alarmed. These things must happen, but the end is still to come. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of birth pains. Then they will deliver you over to be persecuted and killed, and you will be hated by all nations because of My name.\" (Matthew 24:6-9)According to the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency's Antisemitism Report for 2021, the year 2021 was \"the most antisemitic year in the last decade\". The report found that the average number of antisemitic incidents reported in 2021 was more than ten per day, with approximately 50% of attacks occurring in Europe.Unfortunately, antisemitism is not a thing of the past. As the world becomes progressively worse, Jews living in the diaspora will have to make the difficult – yet not unfamiliar – decision to flee again.\n\nSince the establishment of Israel in 1948, more than 3.4 million Jews have made Aliyah to Israel. With the recent Russia-Ukraine war, over a million Ukrainian refugees fled to neighboring countries, and thousands of Ukrainian Jews made an emergency Aliyah, seeking refuge in Israel. How can Israel prepare for the waves of immigrants bound to come from the nations when wars escalate?New immigrants go through many hardships and challenges as they charge forward with courage to begin again in a different culture.At Vision for Israel, we know just how important it is to receive our Jewish brothers and sisters with open arms. That is why we donate household goods such as fans to combat the Israeli heat and provide food baskets and backpacks for their children.Acclimating to a different country is made easier when the local body of Messiah rallies around in support, practically and emotionally. Serving them allows us to hear their stories and hardships and encourage them along the way.As believers, we should pray for the Jews whom God calls back to Israel to receive the grace to uproot and make their home in the land. Let us not forget to lift up the Ministry of Interior, which accompanies the families and aids them in the transition.The first Holocaust survivors to make it to the shores of Israel could never have imagined that one day, millions more would follow in their footsteps. Their bravery and courage serve as an example for new immigrants to believe that they too will successfully triumph over the hardships of immigration.\n\nTheir testimony is a fulfilment of prophecy, as we read in Ezekiel 37:4-6:“Again He said to me, “Prophesy to these bones, and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the LORD! Thus says the Lord GOD to these bones: “Surely I will cause breath to enter into you, and you shall live. I will put sinews on you and bring flesh upon you, cover you with skin and put breath in you; and you shall live. Then you shall know that I am the LORD.”\n\nOn this Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the survivors who journeyed to Israel and made it the incredible nation it is today.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

They managed to escape death in the ghettos and hiding places, faced the brutal winters with a lack of food and clothing, and escaped to the land of Israel in the dead of night.About 250,000 Jews found refuge in different countries. Of these, over 136,000 immigrated to Israel, about 80,000 immigrated to the USA, and others to Canada, Central and Western Europe, Russia, Ukraine, South Africa, and more. “Habrichah\" (The Escape) organization helped many of them to move from Eastern Europe to the West, and then to the land of Israel.\n\nHolocaust refugees are Jews who survived the Holocaust, the Nazi regime, and the occupation of Nazi Germany, and at the end of the war did not immigrate to Israel and did not find a permanent place of settlement. These survivors wandered in Europe or were housed in displaced-person camps.In 1941, the Nazis were at the decisive stage of their plot to \"solve the Jewish problem\" with \"Operation Barbarossa\" — the invasion of the Soviet Union by the German army with the aim of winning the war before the upcoming winter. During this period, approximately 4.855 million Jews lived in the Soviet Union, which was about 30% of the world's population of Jewish people. Only about 800,000 Jews lived outside the occupied areas. About 1.2-1.6 million Jews were evacuated to the East. It is estimated that most of the Jews who remained in the occupied areas, approximately 3 million, were killed in the extermination camps.By the end of 1942, about 1.5 million Jews were murdered in the territories of the Soviet Union occupied by the Nazis. After the war, many of the Jews from the Soviet Union did not return to their homes. Many houses were destroyed, burned, looted, and inhabited by non-Jewish citizens after the Jews were sent to concentration camps. At the end of the war, the surviving Jews were destitute. Due to the anti-Semitism that still existed, hundreds of thousands of Jewish refugees wandered in Europe instead of returning to their country of origin.Those who returned to their country settled mainly in Moscow and Leningrad, following the industrial, scientific, and educational development. The Jews of the Soviet Union grew firm roots, integrated into society, and learned Russian. In 1948, with the establishment of the Jewish state and the rise of anti-Semitism, the desire to reach the land of Israel was sparked in the hearts of the refugees.Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union after World War II was one of the largest in history. It is estimated that 2.75 million Jews from the Soviet Union immigrated to Israel, the USA, Germany, and other countries.\n\nThe Holocaust was indeed over, but the challenges did not stop. Many of the Jews who survived the Holocaust lost their family members or their connection with them. Documents and identification papers were also lost, however, this didn’t stop them from looking for their loved ones. Parents anxiously looked for their children, but tragically most did not find them. Those who did locate their children had to ransom them back, and some even had to take them back by force. Some of those children who were given into hiding became orphans, wandered the streets, or were thrown out by the family that hid them.After the war, the number of orphans throughout Europe escalated. Therefore the Zionist youth movements, especially the Dror movement and Hashomer HaTsa’ir, established more than 17 training kibbutzim for youth aged 16-21 in Poland. Because of the many difficulties, many parents sent their children to kibbutzim for children, so that they themselves could reach Israel, as well.A large part of the children did not even know they were Jewish because they stayed with Christian families and in monasteries. As a result, a Jewish-Zionist organization called \"The Zionist Coordination for the Redemption of Jewish Children\" was established. They redeemed these children with money, founded children's villages for them, and gave them a pioneering education that included Hebrew lessons and community life.\n\nSome of the refugees and their descendants made their way to Israel. For Holocaust survivors and refugees, the history of the Jewish people is not just an old story, but life memories and experiences engraved in their veins. Now that they live in Israel, we take every opportunity to make them happy and express our appreciation for them.Over the years, Vision for Israel was given the privilege of serving these heroes, the Holocaust survivors and refugees, who went through hardships and difficult challenges after the war until finally arriving in Israel.Recently, we hosted about 50 Holocaust refugees who belong to an organization for refugees and victims of the Holocaust from the USSR and Eastern Europe in Israel. The members came in a shuttle, sponsored by Vision for Israel, from the city of Holon to our Millennium Center in the city of Modi'in. They enjoyed a musical morning with singing. Music seems to lift their spirit and awaken joy in their heart. The guests danced together with Barry and Batya Segal, and we all experienced great joy as we danced and sang together.The guests enjoyed rich refreshments: a variety of quality sandwiches, desserts, pastries, and a selection of cold and hot drinks. At the end of the event, each one received a gift — a warm duvet for winter. We were so moved to see their smiles, which appeared like sparks of hope on their faces. Everyone left happy, excited, smiling, and feeling loved.We are grateful for each opportunity to hear their stories and learn more about their lives. Especially now, as the Holocaust generation is disappearing, we are honored to enshrine their shared memories in our hearts. For the survivors who went through the worst horrors, these simple acts of kindness warm their hearts, ignite hope, and renew trust in others. All that is required are small acts of love and care, which we do on a regular basis: a visit to their home to alleviate their loneliness, a listening ear, a warm duvet for the winter, a basket of food, and more. Even the smallest act is of great importance to them.\n\nThe Jewish people have always helped each other in difficult times. At the end of the war, Zionist organizations contributed by helping smuggle Jews to the Land of Israel, redeeming lost children and giving them an education, and helping increase the slim chance that they will get back on their feet. And this is what VFI is committed to doing today! The State of Israel was founded on the backs of Holocaust survivors and refugees, who with the remains of their strength, courageously built homes and institutions. They built buildings and houses, raised families, laid the foundations and values of our country, and fought for Israel’s protection and growth. They did it all for the coming generations. They did it for us so that we can live here in peace and abundance.Today, there are approximately 161,400 Holocaust survivors living in Israel. Not everyone has family or friends, and they face the difficulties of modern life, which they did not even imagine when they founded the country. Many of them do not have enough money to cover their monthly expenses. The stipend given to them by the state is not enough to survive. Their refrigerator is regularly almost empty and they don't turn on electrical appliances in order to save on expenses. During the cold winters, they layer on warm clothes instead of using a heater, if they even have one. On top of all of this, many of them experience crippling loneliness and a feeling of neglect and abandonment.We should not neglect our elderly brothers and sisters in their plight in old age. So, how can we support these survivors and refugees for all they have done?At Vision for Israel, we recognize the past of Holocaust survivors and refugees. We want to give them the loving care and treatment they deserve. We hold events for the refugees and survivors of the Holocaust with the aim of giving them back their sense of belonging and the joy of life. We do this by not only telling them with words but also with actions, that they are important to us and we haven’t forgotten about them. Every joy-filled event, warm blanket, food basket, gift card, and a home visit, positively affect the lives of Holocaust survivors and refugees.We thank all the donors, supporters, and volunteers who contribute their money, time, and energy toward Holocaust survivors and refugees. Without you, we would not have seen the happy smiles on their faces. Thanks to you, they feel respected and appreciated, especially after all the horrors they have gone through in their lives.Thank you for showing love and care to these precious Holocaust Survivors and refugees! And thank you for continuing to support them in their last years of life.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

This time of year is usually filled with hopeful anticipation—a season of reflection and preparation.But for thousands of families across Israel, this summer looks entirely different.In the aftermath of the recent war with Iran and the ongoing war in Gaza, the damage has been severe and widespread. Entire neighborhoods have been destroyed. Homes have been reduced to rubble. Families have lost not only their possessions but the very sense of security and routine that once anchored their lives.Over 17,000 evacuees are now living in temporary housing situations. Many fled with only what they could carry, and they now face the overwhelming task of rebuilding their lives from the ground up. They are not just without homes—they are without the basic tools to begin again.At Vision for Israel, we are standing in the gap, offering immediate and compassionate aid to those caught in this new and painful cycle of need.As the high holidays approach, we are providing magnetic gift cards that can be used in supermarkets and other stores across the country. Each family receives $100. These cards allow families to purchase food and daily necessities—helping to restore not just their cupboards, but their dignity. Giving a mother the ability to choose what her family eats, or a father the chance to buy school supplies for his children—these are powerful, healing acts made possible by your generosity. But the need this year is greater than ever.Every gift card we distribute helps restore what was lost—not just physically, but emotionally. These families are not just in crisis—they are grieving, adjusting, and trying to find the courage to keep moving forward.The back-to-school season is always a financial strain for low-income families, but this year it comes on the heels of unimaginable loss. Children who should be shopping for backpacks and notebooks are instead asking where they will sleep tonight. And as the High Holidays approach—a time meant for celebration, prayer, and community—many are wondering how they will set even the most basic holiday table.We cannot ignore their suffering. We must not turn away.Your gift of $100 allows us to continue delivering help directly to those in need. It enables us to provide timely aid during the most vulnerable moments and to serve as a bridge between despair and hope. Each gift you send becomes part of someone’s restoration story.Together, we can ensure that more families receive the tools they need to survive this season and prepare for a better future.Please give generously today.Your compassion brings comfort. Your prayers bring strength. And your giving brings life.As we prepare for the sacred days of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Sukkot, may we remember those who are still in the wilderness of loss—and may we answer their need with love and action.Todah Rabah and Shalom to you and your loved ones,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,As we approach Father's Day and celebrate the remarkable 30-year journey of Vision for Israel, we are reminded of the deep biblical roots that emphasize the sacred bond between parents and children. The Torah, filled with commandments about this vital relationship, instructs us on the significance of honoring and revering our parents as an expression of honoring God Himself. It promises longevity and prosperity to those who adhere to this divine wisdom.Parenting, as envisioned by our scriptures, is not merely a series of duties but a holy covenant with God to raise children in His ways. This Father's Day, let us remember all fathers and father figures who guide us with strength and wisdom.This month, as Vision for Israel marks its 30th anniversary, we reflect on our commitment to embody these scriptural principles through our actions. It's a commitment that has not only helped to nurture the physical and spiritual well-being of countless lives but also to restore hope where it was once lost.In honor of this special day, we are thrilled to announce a new initiative aimed at healing the young hearts that ache the most — the orphans in the southern regions who lost their fathers on October 7th and the war that followed. These children require more than just physical necessities; they need the emotional support that can be provided by local activities. Vision for Israel is organizing a special day dedicated to caring for these precious children. Professional advisors are meticulously planning the activities to ensure a meaningful experience. We have a budget of $15,000 to cover all expenses. Please join us in this noble cause by contributing to make this day truly special.Your support will bring smiles and offer a sense of belonging to these children, helping them feel loved and cherished.Let us come together this Father’s Day to bless our earthly fathers and those who have stood in the gap as father figures. Let us extend our hands in generosity and love toward the children who yearn for paternal care, reflecting the love of the Father who calls us all His children.To contribute, please visit our donation page and dedicate your donation to Aid to the Poor. Your gift will make a profound difference.\n\nShalom and blessings,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,On May 1st, Israel marked her 77th Independence Day—a day filled with celebration, remembrance, and renewed hope. Each year, this day calls us to reflect on the miraculous journey of the Jewish people: a journey of restoration, survival, and the fulfillment of ancient prophecy.Israel’s story is unlike any other. It is a story that begins in the pages of Scripture—when God promised a land to Abraham and his descendants. For centuries, the people of Israel lived in that land, walked its soil, worshipped in its holy places, and built a society rooted in God’s law.

The modern era brought even greater darkness, culminating in the Holocaust—the ultimate act of antisemitism, where six million Jewish lives were cruelly taken.And yet, against all odds, the Jewish people returned to their land.In 1948, after centuries of dispersion, the State of Israel was reborn. For the first time in almost 2,000 years, the Jewish people had a home—a place where Hebrew was once again spoken in the streets, where Jewish children could grow up learning the stories of their ancestors, and where the nation could stand in dignity and strength. Israel’s rebirth was nothing short of a miracle. But as we all know, the journey did not end there.From its very first day, Israel has been under threat. Wars, terror attacks, economic hardship, and political isolation have been constant companions. And yet, through it all, the people of Israel have held on. They’ve rebuilt cities, cultivated the desert, pioneered advancements in science and technology, and opened their arms to immigrants from around the world. Israel remains a refuge for Jews who have nowhere else to go. It is the only true homeland the Jewish people have ever had—or ever will have.But while the achievements of these 77 years are worth celebrating, there are still many in Israel who live in fear and uncertainty—especially in the northern and southern regions near the borders, where the threat of rocket attacks is a daily reality.

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe second quarter of 2025 brought both deep heartbreak and moments of incredible hope across Israel. Amid war, terror, and economic hardship, Vision for Israel continued to reach out with practical support, comfort, and the love of Yeshua. Through your generous giving, we were able to stand alongside those in desperate need—survivors of attacks, struggling families, soldiers, and even the most vulnerable children. Whether through a meal, a shelter, or a simple gift of clothing, every act of kindness carried a message: You are not alone. Below is just a glimpse of how your support made a difference this spring and early summer.\n\nAmid the war with Iran, VFI teams traveled to meet search and rescue soldiers working in the rubble of missile-hit buildings. We served them hot, nourishing hamburger meals with fresh vegetables and fries—small comforts during unimaginable tasks. At a site in Beit Yam, commanders took us on a tour of the devastation. The destruction was horrifying. Yet amid the pain, our presence brought moments of joy and relief. Hundreds of meals were distributed, and the soldiers expressed deep appreciation. It was a sacred privilege to stand beside them—to comfort those who comfort others.\n\nWe visited a central Israel hotel housing families evacuated after losing their homes to missile strikes. Many had fled with nothing but the clothes on their backs. VFI brought packages of clothing, diapers, and toys for the children. As we handed them out, parents embraced us with tears and gratitude. The packages were more than material help—they were a message of solidarity. One father said it best: “You reminded us that we’re not forgotten.” In times of war, these gestures are lifelines, and we are honored to extend your love to those most in need.\n\nAhead of Passover, we provided financial assistance to over 1,200 welfare families across central and southern Israel. Gift cards were distributed in cities including Petach Tikva, Rosh Ha’Ayin, Modiin, Kiryat Malachi, Sderot, and Netivot. The project was carried out in coordination with municipal welfare departments, who helped oversee the distributions. These families are living in financial crisis, and for many, this assistance meant the difference between celebrating Passover with dignity or going without. One welfare worker said our presence always touches her deeply. The families’ gratitude was overwhelming, and their smiles reminded us why this mission is so important.\n\nIn May, we met a young man named O., who had been stabbed in a terrorist attack in Tel Aviv just months before. The attack left him with physical injuries and deep emotional scars. Nightmares, anxiety, and fear have become part of his daily life. He shared how difficult it is to navigate bureaucracy in order to receive help. In response, VFI stepped in to sponsor his therapy sessions. O. is now undergoing treatment alongside other terror victims. He was visibly moved—not only by the financial help, but by the genuine care he received. For him, that emotional embrace meant everything.\n\nVFI delivered over 400 items of seasonal clothing to refugee children in Tel Aviv, aged 5–12. These children, many from families without legal status, live in harsh conditions and face deportation threats. Though the law entitles them to education, most lack access to quality schooling and basic necessities. Some are at risk of turning to crime due to extreme poverty and lack of opportunity. The organization we partnered with supports these families, and with our help, has previously provided backpacks and school supplies. This recent clothing donation was a lifeline—meeting both physical and emotional needs for children society often overlooks.\n\nIn Jaffa, we donated 300 clothing items to a daycare center serving at-risk children aged 4–6. These little ones come from deeply impoverished families, where parents often work long hours and struggle to provide even the basics. The daycare center is a haven where some children receive their only meal of the day. Malka, the house mother, told us how critical this donation was—many of the children simply don’t have adequate clothing. She blessed our team and our donors with heartfelt thanks, reminding us that small gifts of compassion can change a child’s outlook on life.\n\nA battalion from the Negev Brigade, serving deep inside the Gaza Strip, received a portable solar power station from VFI. This device—valued at nearly 3,000 NIS—allows soldiers to generate electricity in the field for charging gear, operating appliances, and even cooking. The sergeant major who collected the equipment shared that despite being in reserve duty for over 500 days, the battalion’s morale remains high. Their mission is clear: to return the kidnapped and protect Israel’s borders. This practical donation boosted the soldiers' capabilities and morale, serving as a reminder that people around the world stand behind them.\n\nIn response to continued rocket threats near the Gaza border, we installed six more safety shelters in frontline communities. Since the horrific October 7 attack, Vision for Israel has made it a priority to increase civilian protection. These new shelters were placed in coordination with local officials and the Home Front Command. In Ofakim, one shelter was dedicated in memory of Shahar Gez, a young man who lost his life before he could join the IDF. His family participated in the memorial installation. So far, thanks to your donations, 438 shelters have been installed—each one a beacon of safety and hope.\n\nWe welcomed Holocaust survivors from Beersheva to a joyful event at the Millennium Center, where we served a nutritious breakfast, live entertainment, and a space for connection. One participant said, “As long as you can move your legs—it is good!” As the music played, many stood up and danced, radiating resilience and life. These moments are priceless. Survivors shared how much the event meant to them, lifting their spirits and giving them renewed strength. “You made our day,” one said. Events like these are more than entertainment—they are a statement that we remember, honor, and cherish their lives.\n\nThe wives of reserve soldiers carry heavy emotional and practical burdens as their husbands serve far from home. In June, we hosted a special event at the Millennium Center for 30 such women. Designed for pampering and renewal, the event included massages, workshops, and heartfelt conversations. These women are often left without government support, raising children alone and shouldering fear for their husbands' safety. Our goal was to say: we see you, we honor you. As one woman said with tears in her eyes, the embrace from Vision for Israel helped her feel less alone. That’s the heart of our mission.\n\nDonate now to help bring comfort, shelter, and hope to Israelis in crisis.\n\nChazak u’Baruch – Be strong and blessed.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

This November, Vision for Israel will be launching a series of therapeutic workshops designed to bring healing and comfort to these brave women who have endured unimaginable loss.One such woman is Shoshana, who recently faced a harrowing experience that will forever mark her family. On the morning of October 7, Simchat Torah, Shoshana, her husband Ariel, their children, and extended family celebrated the holiday at their in-laws' home in Ofakim. Suddenly, the tranquility was shattered by the sound of sirens and gunfire. As they sought shelter, it became clear that the very streets they lived on had become a battleground.Amid this terror, Shoshana’s husband, Ariel, showed extraordinary bravery. As terrorists attempted to break into their home, Ariel urged Shoshana and the children to escape through a window. While Shoshana, her sister-in-law Michal, and their children hid on the roof, Ariel stayed behind, ultimately sacrificing his life to protect his loved ones. His actions were nothing short of heroic, and his family believes that his sacrifice was what saved them.Now, Shoshana and many others like her are left to navigate the overwhelming grief and trauma of such profound loss. These therapeutic workshops, beginning with a pilot event at the Millennium Center, are designed to offer a safe space for healing, where widows like Shoshana can find comfort, express their emotions, and begin to rebuild their lives.Each workshop will include a half-day of creative activities, a relaxing brunch, and a special gift for every participant. The first event will host 50 women, and each subsequent workshop will welcome a different group, ensuring that as many as possible receive the care and support they desperately need.We believe in the power of creativity and community to heal the brokenhearted. Through art, fellowship, and shared experiences, these workshops will provide a lifeline to those who need it most. But we cannot do this alone. We need your help to make these events possible.Your donation will directly support these workshops, funding the materials, meals, and gifts that will uplift these women during their darkest hours. With your support, we can expand this project to reach even more widows who are in desperate need of comfort and care.Please consider donating today to help us bring healing to the widows of terror victims in Israel. Together, we can offer them the hope and support they need to move forward.Thank you for your compassion and support.

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nWhat comes to mind when you think of the word 'orphan'?You might think of a lonely child in an orphanage praying for a place to call home, barefoot and dirty children begging for food on the roadside, or a young and unprepared mother leaving her baby in the hands of strangers.What you probably didn't envision is a beautiful queen draped in the finest of robes and feasting in a royal banquet hall with a king.I'm sure Queen Esther herself could never have imagined that one day, an orphan like herself would go from the slums of Susa in Persia (modern-day Iran) to saving all exiled Jews from India to Cush (part of modern-day Africa).Her brave and courageous actions have been commemorated throughout all generations and since then have become a Jewish national holiday called Purim.On Purim, the story of Esther is read in the synagogues, and gift baskets filled with hamantaschen, baked goods, snacks, wine, and groggers are given to neighbors, friends, family, and loved ones. Children and adults dress up in original costumes and creative masks in honor of Queen Esther, who hid her Jewish identity, and people party and dance into the night.But before we skip to her triumphant ending, the beginning of Esther's life was no fairytale:\n\n“And Mordecai had brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter, for she had neither father nor mother. The young woman was lovely and beautiful. When her father and mother died, Mordecai took her as his own daughter.” – Esther 2:7\n\nEsther was an orphan girl living in exile in Susa. She didn't have much, but what she did have was beauty.As King Xerses had banished Queen Vashti for her refusal to join him at his royal banquet, he set out to find a young and beautiful young woman in her stead. Soon, she was taken to the royal palace together with many other young virgins to compete for the chance of becoming queen.Esther found favor with everyone who laid eyes upon her. She underwent months of beauty treatments, ate special food, and was given seven female attendants to serve at her beck and call. Out of all the lovely young women, King Xerses chose Esther and crowned her as queen.If you thought that was her happily ever after, think again--a sinister danger was lurking beneath the surface in the form of a power-thirsty and influential man named Haman.Haman was infuriated with Esther's uncle, Mordecai, who would not bow down to honor him as he passed at the city gate. So, he convinced King Xerxes to decree all Jews to be killed. Upon receiving this dire news, Esther had a decision to make--would she expose her identity to save her people? Or would she continue to hide to save her own skin?\n\n\"Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: “Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the King, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.\" - Esther 4:15-16\n\nAn orphan child is miraculously elevated to a position of power and wealth only to come face to face with one of Jewish history's most critical moments. Most would dismiss this orphan girl as powerless to save her people, who could be wiped out on a whim of a temperamental and merciless government official and the seal of a king's ring.The early days of Esther's hard life prepared her to become a woman of brave character and great wisdom -- noble enough to risk her own life to save her people.Where is God in all this? Was He blind to the evil plan threatening to demolish His people?Although God is not clearly referred to by name in the book of Esther, His presence shines through and through.What does the Bible say about the orphan and the fatherless?God’s word is very clear that His heart goes out to the orphan and the fatherless and that He is there to defend them from all harm and see that they have everything they need.\n\nHe defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow, and loves the foreigner residing among you, giving them food and clothing. – Deuteronomy 10:18\n\nYeshua cared for the orphan, the widow, and the lowly; in fact, His life and ministry were dedicated to uplifting the downtrodden, and He performed many miracles to prove it.He resurrected a widow's only son being carried out the city gate to be buried (Luke 7:11-17), honored and encouraged those living in poverty (luke 6:20-21), and taught His disciples to live out their faith in acts of service as in James 1:27:\n\n\"Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.\"\n\nClearly, Esther did not forget where she came from, and she stepped out in courage and fought for the rights of the powerless and the oppressed. Risking her own life, she exposed her Jewish identity to King Xerxes, pleading with him to spare her and her people and put an end to the evil plans of Haman.Does that sound familiar? Yeshua did the same for us. Taking on the role of a humble servant kneeling before a powerful king, He too fought to cancel the enemy's plans when He pleaded to God the Father to forgive us our sins. Or as the psalmist Asaph says in Psalm 82:2-3:\n\n\"Defend the weak and the fatherless; uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.\"\n\nThe story of Esther comes to prove that no matter what unfortunate circumstances distress your life, there is a hero inside of each and every one of us; and that the 'widow and the orphan' are not second-class citizens but strong and resilient individuals that, given the opportunity, have the ability to rise up in the face of dire circumstances with courage some could only dream of having.Just as Yeshua and Esther remembered the downtrodden and powerless and fought for their case -- so must we. Purim is a time of celebrating victory over evil, from which we still benefit today. However, we must also remember that the poor are still with us.Every day, children are still abandoned by their parents, a spouse might suddenly lose their husband or wife and poverty still weighs heavy on the lives of hard-working families.Purim is an opportunity, not just to celebrate the heroic acts of Esther and the eternal forgiveness of Yeshua, but also to give gifts to the poor.The Jewish people call this tradition in Hebrew 'Matanot L'evyonim', which means gifts to the poor. Anything from giving in a financial way or donating in other means is an excellent way to fulfill this heartfelt Purim tradition.It is good to remember the exemplary acts of Yeshua and the courageous actions of Queen Esther. You and I might not have been born with royal blood by birth, but through Yeshua, we possess a nobility that comes from within. And that nobility? That can save the world.As we say in Hebrew, Mishenichnas Adar marbin b’simcha—When the month of Adar begins, our joy increases!Wishing you a Happy Purim!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Anything from giving in a financial way or donating in other means is an excellent way to fulfill this heartfelt Purim tradition.<br/><br/>It is good to remember the exemplary acts of Yeshua and the courageous actions of Queen Esther. <br/><br/>You and I might not have been born with royal blood by birth, but through Yeshua, we possess a nobility that comes from within. And that nobility? That can save the world.<br/><br/>As we say in Hebrew, <em>Mishenichnas Adar marbin b’simch</em>a—When the month of Adar begins, our joy increases!<br/><br/>Wishing you a Happy Purim!</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nNow more than ever, Christians need to know just how important it is to bless the nation of Israel. Let’s dive into the word of God to discover more of God’s heart about blessing Israel.\n\nDid you know that our God is a covenant-making and covenant-keeping God? God made covenants with Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. After God flooded the earth, He made a covenant with Noah saying:\n\n“I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind. Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living creatures of every kind on the earth.” (Genesis 9:15-16)\n\nSeveral hundred years passed and God was faithful to keep His covenant with Noah by multiplying and increasing families on the earth. The next covenant God made was with Abram:\n\n“The Lord had said to Abram, ‘Go from your country, your people, and your father’s household to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse, and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you.’” (Genesis 12:1-3)\n\nGod was telling Abram and his wife Sarai, who were unable to conceive that they would bear children and their descendants would become a great nation. Can you imagine the unbelief that Abram and Sarai battled? God spoke again to Abram and told him that he would make his offspring as many as the stars in the sky. And what was Abram’s response?... “Abram believed the Lord, and he credited it to him as righteousness.” (Genesis 15:6)We can learn from Abram to believe what the Lord tells us because God will credit it to us as righteousness. So, if God says that He will bless those who bless Israel, then we need to believe the Lord in this matter as well. Let us choose to believe that when we bless Israel, God will bless us, too!However, we know how this story goes. Many years went by and Abram and Sarai became weary in the waiting. They ended up taking matters into their own hands and disobeying God. When Abram was 86 years old, Sarai’s maidservant, Hagar, gave birth to Ishmael. However, our covenant-keeping God was gracious and faithful to fulfill his covenant. 14 years later, God reminded Abram of the covenant He made with him:\n\n“When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the Lord appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty; walk before me faithfully and be blameless. Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers.” (Genesis 17:1-2)\n\nWhen God made the covenant with Abram, He also made the covenant with Sarai. Therefore, the promise from God could only be fulfilled through Abram and Sarai, and no one else. Despite their disobedience, God declared His covenant would still come to be through Abram and Sarai. God changed their names, declared that Abraham would be the father of many nations, declared that Sarah would be the mother of many nations, and promised them that the covenant would be made through their son Isaac.\n\n“No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you. The whole land of Canaan, where you now reside as a foreigner, I will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you; and I will be their God.” (Genesis 17:5-8)\n\nGod was making an everlasting covenant with Abraham and Sarah saying that He would not only make their descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky but also that He would be their God and give them possession of the land of Canaan.\n\nGod was faithful to keep his covenant through Abraham, his son Isaac, and then through Isaac’s son, Jacob. At the end of his life, Isaac blessed Jacob, saying: “May nations serve you and peoples bow down to you. Be lord over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. May those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed.” (Genesis 27:29) Isaac blessed Jacob with the covenant that God made with Abraham and said:\n\n“May he give you and your descendants the blessing given to Abraham, so that you may take possession of the land where you now reside as a foreigner, the land God gave to Abraham.” (Genesis 28:4)\n\nIt is fascinating to see this covenant from the Lord being preserved from father to son over and over throughout many generations of the Jewish people. It is important to take time to understand this everlasting covenant that God made with the Jewish people and how it affects each one of us today.\n\nNow that we know what we need to do, it's time to discover why we should bless Israel. Let’s take a look at the interactions between Balak and Balaam in the book of Numbers chapters 23 and 24. Balak was trying to get Balaam to curse Israel, but each time Balaam prayed, he blessed Israel. Balaam delivered a word of the Lord to Balak in Numbers 23:7-8 saying, “Then Balaam spoke his message: ‘Balak brought me from Aram, the king of Moab from the eastern mountains. ‘Come,’ he said, ‘curse Jacob for me; come, denounce Israel.’ How can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I denounce those whom God has not denounced?”Several times Balak tried to get Balaam to curse the Israelites, but Balaam was only able to say what God wanted him to say, which was to bless Israel. After several times of praying and blessing Israel, Balaam realized that it pleased the Lord to bless the People of Israel!\n\n“Now when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he did not resort to divination as at other times, but turned his face toward the wilderness.” - Numbers 24:1\n\nSo, why should we bless Israel? One answer is that it pleases the Lord. God chose to make a covenant with the Jewish people and he wants to bless them. Therefore, if we bless Israel, then God will bless us. However, if we curse Israel, then we will receive a curse in return.\n\nAnother important reason to bless Israel is because there are consequences if we choose not to bless Israel. When someone curses Israel, they will be cursed in return. From the example of Balak and Balaam’s interactions, we can also see this truth. Balak tried to get Balaam to curse Israel 3 different times, and because of this God cursed Balak and his people. We have also seen a very clear picture of this during the Iron Swords War. We can see God’s hand coming against the nations and people who curse Israel. On December 14th, 2023, a Turkish lawmaker was speaking in parliament and criticizing Israel. As soon as he finished his speech about Israel, he instantly had a heart attack and collapsed on stage. Two days later, he died. There are great blessings that come if we choose to bless Israel, and there are terrible consequences that come if we choose to curse Israel. And now that we have looked at several scriptures in the Bible explaining this truth, we hope you all are encouraged to not only bless Israel but also to encourage others to do the same!\n\n“Blessed are you, Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the Lord? He is your shield and helper and your glorious sword. Your enemies will cower before you, and you will tread on their heights.” -Deuteronomy 33:29\n\nNow the question is: ‘How do we bless Israel’? We believe that blessing Israel means understanding God’s heart for this nation and people, and obeying what God puts on your heart. Blessing Israel looks like getting on our knees and praying for this nation, especially now, during the war. Blessing Israel looks like speaking truth and life over this nation and people, especially when others curse and express hatred towards Israel. Blessing Israel looks like giving your time, finances, energy, and support to show love to these people that God has made an everlasting covenant with. With all of this talk about ‘blessing Israel’, let’s get practical and put this truth into action.Here are some practical ways that you can bless Israel through VFI today:1.

This is what we’ve been up to.\n\nRecently, our team at Vision for Israel held Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebration for young adults who have experienced terrorism. Many of these individuals wouldn't be able to celebrate this major milestone without the support of our generous donors.\n\nThis is a letter from President Yitzhak Herzog after the Bar Mitzvah event that took place at his residence for 60 children, victims of hostilities:Dear Barry and Batya,I was excited to receive your letter and I want to thank you for yourcondolences and care following my mother’s passing away.I was happy to see you and get to know VFI’s activity at the recent\n\nBar and Bat Mitzvah event—and even more so, the story that you broughtto my attention in the letter touched my heart. Your ability to look with openeyes at the reality; to recruit partners, resources, time, and means to help theunderprivileged in general and terror survivors, in particular, is inspiring andenables all of us to have an optimistic outlook on the future of the state ofIsrael. I wish you both a long life with health and goodness,and may you continue the meaningful work for the entire Israeli society.\n\nYour success is the success of us all.Warm wishes,\n\nYitzhak HerzogPresident\n\nWe started the year already in full swing, beginning with the distribution of food baskets to low-income families. May we always have an abundance of supplies to give freely.\n\nVision for Israel takes care of Holocaust survivors’ needs every day. We hold weekly social events to help them emotionally cope with the challenges they are going through, and sponsor 500 survivors every month, to receive life-saving panic buttons should they suffer from a fall or other medical emergencies. Together, we are extending God’s care to these dear individuals.\n\nThanks to our loyal friends and donors, Vision for Israel recently placed mobile shelters throughout the Gaza Envelope settlements, including Okafim, Netivot, Kibbutz Nir Am, Giv’olim, Dorot, and Gevim. A total of 48 shelters have been placed thanks to the donors of Vision for Israel, and we are planning on donating more shelters as soon as possible. All shelters are located near public spaces, parks, schools, neighborhoods, and shopping centers so that the maximum number of people have access in case of an emergency.\n\nAt Vision for Israel, we are working on rehabilitation through music and the arts. The workshops we provide approach social justice from a new angle, giving several groups of people an opportunity to grow and heal.The cost for each participant is about $200 and our goal is to sponsor 100 people. This has the capacity to change endless lives, heal generational trauma, and further the mission of social justice well into the future.\n\nWe are preparing to help the families arriving in Israel as much as we can with daily, basic needs and support. These refugees need shelter, food, hygiene products, clothing, shoes, and other basic necessities that the Israeli government is not providing. We are here to fill that gap and make sure that these newcomers feel love and support from the Lord.\n\nVision for Israel sent assistance to our friends who are on the borders of Ukraine. Rescuers Without Borders, an Israeli organization and partner of ours, has sent medical professionals there. We continue to send them funding as we have for many years. With your help, they are able to purchase medicine, food, clothes, blankets, and other support items for refugees who have made it to the safety of Ukrainian border countries like Poland.\n\nWe opened the doors of the Millennium Center to families of victims of terror and violence for Purim this year. Hundreds of parents, children, and grandparents came dressed up in costumes to celebrate and enjoy themselves. MDA volunteers provided an ambulance and volunteers, to make sure that everyone stayed safe all day long. This reassurance is key for many terror survivors.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe work of Vision for Israel is continuing at a great pace. During this period VFI had many ongoing activities including the vital need for mobile bomb shelters in the south, Pack To School deliveries, and our ongoing support to the poor and needy. We were able to provide assistance with emergency and rescue equipment including medications to a team of doctors and paramedics who were on the Ukrainian-Polish border. During the same period, we celebrated Holocaust survivors and supported terror victims. We are honored to provide assistance where it's needed. This is possible thanks to God’s love and the generosity of our partners.\n\nWe are helping the families arriving in Israel as much as we can with daily, basic needs and support. Many people need shelter, food, hygiene products, clothing, shoes, and other basic necessities that the Israeli government is not providing. We are here to fill that gap and make sure that these newcomers feel love and support from the Lord. Recently, we were able to give aid to Ukrainian refugees and new immigrants arriving in Israel.\n\nThousands of rockets land in Israel, mainly on the southern border. Citizens live in daily survival and terrible anxiety. From the moment the alarm sounds until the rocket hits the ground, there are 15-45 seconds to reach a shelter. Dozens of shelters have been set up in many cities and towns in the south of the country through the generosity of VFI’s partners.\n\nFor You have been a shelter for me,\n\nA strong tower from the enemy. – Psalm 61:3\n\nIn honor of Women's Day, we were happy to give 200 women, members of the Organization of Victims of Hostilities, a pampering and empowering day. The women enjoyed beauty classes and shiatsu and reflexology treatments, guest speakers, and a comedy show at lunch. At the end of the event, each lady received a package of skin care creams. The women expressed gratitude for the successful and impressive event, and we were delighted to give them a respite from their difficulty coping with the trauma.\n\nShe opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. - Proverbs 31:26\n\nFor Passover, we provided monetary support to soldiers who are facing financial challenges. One of them is Hadar*, an outstanding and brave soldier. In 2016, when she was only 13, Hadar was seriously injured in an act of terrorism. Her father was killed on the spot, and her mother and brother were seriously injured. Hadar managed to pull her parents out of the vehicle and seek help.As the daughter of a bereaved family, she needed a signed permit from her mother to join the IDF. Though her mother suffered a serious head injury and extensive rehabilitation, she signed without any hesitation. The strong value of defending the homeland has seeped deep into Hadar, who serves with courage, heroism, and excellence.*Name has been changed\n\nDuring Passover, we were reminded of how God protected and saved His people from Egypt. We shared this joy with hundreds of families who received magnetic gift cards for shopping for the holiday. As we have staff members from Ethiopia, it was special for us to deliver aid to the lovely Ethiopian community. Thank you for spreading joy and life in Israel this Passover.\n\nWe recently hosted an exciting event for 50 Holocaust survivors, Hebrew and Russian-speaking, members of the Cafe Europa social club from the city of Arad. The Holocaust survivors came to the Millennium Center for a musical morning full of fun and joy that included singing and dancing with 3 musicians. It was so exciting to see the survivors singing, dancing, and having fun. This was the first event that the survivors went to since the Covid pandemic began and they were very excited and happy to be there.\n\nRecently Vision for Israel sponsored yet another cultural event supporting survivors of terrorism.In cooperation with the Representative Organization of Victims of Hostilities, we held a cultural evening at the Arts Center in the neighborhood of Pisgat Ze'ev in Jerusalem.About 307 survivors of hostilities and 35 Holocaust survivors came to watch the musical \"Bustan Sephardi\" (A Spanish Garden) by the Habima Theater, directed by Tzadi Tzarfati.\n\nOn a beautiful spring morning, 45 Holocaust survivors traveled from Be'er Sheva to the Millennium Center in Modi'in for a day of fun and appreciation. The tables were filled with delicious refreshments and drinks. As they enjoyed these treats, they socialized together as many of them, being elderly, are often alone and without company. With such great joy in the air, the survivors got up from their tables and broke out in a youthful dance session. They even formed a conga line and danced all around the lobby, with Barry and Batya sharing in this precious moment.\n\nA time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance; - Ecclesiastes 3:4\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Here are some highlights from our recent activities.\n\nThis has been an amazing summer. We have been hard at work helping anyone and everyone that we can and spreading God’s light throughout our community. Though we know that this work has amazing effects, sometimes it really strikes us how much of an impact we can make through God and our donors and friends.Imagine all the 275,000 children who were the recipients of VFI’s school bags over the years coming together to shout “thank you!” The sound would be tremendous. It is this reality that keeps us going.It warms our hearts when we interact with these children and their parents. Their joy and laughter at our events bring out the children in us too, something that is rare and cherished as the years pass. Through the eyes of these children and their smiles, we can relive our own childhoods. Our ability to help them attend school and gain education is nothing but a blessing.\n\nIn August, we donated two more vehicles to MDA (Magen David Adom): a bloodmobile, and a mobile intensive care unit ambulance (MICU). The dedication event was heartfelt and meaningful, full of sincere speeches and gratitude. So far, over 30,000 emergency responses have occurred with all the vehicles that we have donated. Saving lives and saving people is what it is all about!\n\nEvery year, the weeks before the Jewish High Holidays are especially busy for us at Vision for Israel. One of VFI’s main activities is the distribution of magnetic gift cards to low-income families, the elderly, Holocaust survivors, new immigrants, terror survivors, and lone soldiers.Many times, a gift card means the world to them, especially in preparation for the holidays. This time of year means more expenses and more preparation for family meals and celebrations. Our magnetic gift cards help to ease financial stress and help families to celebrate the High Holidays properly.\n\nWe held a ceremony at the Millennium Center for 52 terror survivor students and their families. The students received scholarships to help them with their higher education. There was a moving speech and beautiful music. The latter was performed by a musician who lost both his parents in an act of terrorism.Giving scholarships brought intense joy to many of these students, and allowed us to help to ease some of the pain and hardship that they carry.\n\nWhen the rockets were falling on us, we found ourselves praying for God's intervention. Our prayers—and our appeals to you, our faithful partners—have been answered. Thanks to your generous participation and faith in our work and in God, we have now ordered enough shelters and locking systems for the first stage of our goal.\n\nWe are so incredibly grateful to have received a donation of 1,020 new pairs of denim overalls from the Netherlands.Our team at Vision for Israel donates the clothing we receive to needy families. We also give to children’s homes and at-risk children, as well as young people with unique emotional and cognitive needs. Our donors in this arena have always been so generous, and we are continually grateful.\n\nHunger does not only exist during the holiday season, so we work with food donations all year long. Our wonderful volunteers have helped us pack hundreds of baskets during every donation event. We then distribute the baskets along with magnetic cards for purchasing food at the major food chains. Dozens of families come to various centers across the country to receive the assistance. We work in collaboration with the welfare departments to locate the people who need help the most. This month, our team distributed food baskets in Neve Yaakov in Jerusalem and Rishon Lezion. We see these baskets making a huge difference for some families, and all of them are so grateful to our donors for making our work possible.\n\nIt's always good when our partnerships with organizations and nonprofits expand. Recently we sorted and packed lots of items to donate to charities. Among the objects were clothing and shoes, medical equipment, tools, housewares, undergarments, bedding, school bags, and more. The organizations that receive the donations address important issues in Israeli society, such as helping minorities, rescue and disaster relief, combating domestic violence, and helping school dropouts.With the help of our partner organizations, we can reach out to more and more people in need.\n\nAs we do every year, this winter we will hold a festive event for dozens of bar and bat mitzvah boys and girls from families affected by terrorist attacks. We do this together with other organizations that represent the victims of hostilities and terrorism.The work begins months in advance, as we plan and improve our methods. All of us are very excited and hope to hold a moving, significant, and memorable event this year for these dear children, who have endured more in the past few years than many of us have in our whole lives.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Thanks to your generous donations and partnership, we can give more and increase the number of recipients. As Israelis living within our people, we will continue to restore, support the weak population, embrace all those around us and say “Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever” (Psalm 107:1).\n\nEvery summer before the school year begins, our Vision for Israel team distributes school bags to children from distressed families.\n\nNo community is unaffected by financial difficulty in Israel, from religious to secular, Arab and Ethiopian, new immigrants, victims of terrorism, at-risk children, asylum seekers, migrant workers, and more.\n\nOur heart is to reach every child in need and ensure they begin the new school year confident, equal to their peers, and ready to focus on academics.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine continues to cause a significant immigration crisis. Refugees and new immigrants arriving in Israel suffer from post-trauma and severe economic hardship.\n\nVision for Israel is in contact with organizations that provide aid to refugees – supplying them with clothing, textiles, and essential equipment. In partnership with these organizations, we distributed equipment for children, babies, women, and men as a donation with the intent of helping them rebuild their lives.\n\nOur hearts are with the lost, and we hope that through these donations, they will feel the warmth of a home they left behind.\n\nOne of the causes dear to our hearts is the brave victims of hostilities, people who are salt of the earth, overcoming extreme hardship to continue to be a rock and a pillar for their families.\n\nFor several years, we have had the privilege to support and collaborate with the organization of victims of hostilities in a scholarship initiative. Through this partnership, we have been able to touch many families in need of assistance by awarding 76 scholarships to students who most needed the blessed assistance.\n\nWe at Vision for Israel continue the operation to provide resources and protection for those living in the south, especially for the cities located near conflict areas.\n\nIn the last year, close to 90 bomb shelters were installed. It is an honor and privilege as an organization to help provide safety and security for those around the nation. Your generosity and kindness are an active part of saving lives during times of war!\n\nThe summer holiday has just come to an end in Israel. With the rise of inflation and kids being out of school, expenses were higher than usual, and many parents had difficulty working.\n\nVision for Israel regularly distributes food baskets to needy families, including several cities in the center and south of the country. The smiles and words of gratitude from those receiving the aid warmed our hearts, and we were elated for the opportunity to help them during the challenging summer vacation.\n\nWith the High Holidays upon us, and as we enter a season of new beginnings, Vision for Israel has not forgotten the hungry as no one should ever be without the means to celebrate with a festive meal.\n\nGratefully, we were able to pass out financial vouchers to hundreds of individuals and families in need in cities and communities in central Israel, and the families expressed their heartfelt gratitude for the financial aid they received!\n\nTheir fulfillment is our success, and none of this would be possible without you, our generous donors, who bless the families of Israel!\n\nAfter a two-year hiatus during a difficult world crisis, Vision for Israel is finally hosting tour groups again at the Millennium Center!\n\nWe love hosting, spending time together, and building the Kingdom of God in Israel with you. What doesn't go unnoticed is the constant generosity of our visitors, who bless us with their friendship and bring us essential items for families in need.\n\nThank you for being an essential part of the vision to reach all of Israel!\n\nOne of the families Vision for Israel loves to aid whenever we can, is a precious couple whose lives have been affected by rocket attacks and who recently requested our help purchasing multifocal glasses.\n\nThe father of the family has been recognized as a disabled victim of hostilities since 2005 and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. The mother suffered from cataracts, underwent surgery, and needed multifocal glasses.\n\nWhen we heard of their request, we jumped on the opportunity to make their difficult lives even a little easier.\n\nIn addition to aiding with purchasing the multifocal glasses, we were able to help them every holiday with financial vouchers.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Coming from a complicated family background where she was raised outside her parents’ home, she married and divorced young. And despite the challenges involved in her lifestyle, she does her best to raise her two small children; Alon* who is in 4th grade, and Nimrod* who is in 2nd grade.\n\nBoth of her children have been diagnosed with severe ADD, and are integrated into classrooms with the help of a paraprofessional. The children also face emotional and social difficulties related to their background.\n\nMichal works full-time as a secretary in a real estate appraisal office and is putting forth many efforts to reach financial independence. Still, she struggles. Her many debts make putting food on the table for herself and her children anything but easy.\n\nTo make matters worse, health complications have also hindered her ability to function both as a professional, and as a mother.

Whenever a child of God is in distress or needs support, we do all that we can to provide them with what they need.Yulia* came to us through her Hebrew teacher. This teacher is a family friend of the Segals, and she approached them out of familiarity with VFI's activities.The teacher had noticed that Yulia seemed distressed, and noted that she had been coming to class with puffy eyes and heavy makeup. The teacher asked Yulia about her safety and security at home. Yulia barely had to say anything. The pain and difficulty of her story were written on her face.Yulia has no family in Israel except her two young children. Both children have special needs and require additional care. She speaks only Russian, but she is studying Hebrew to be able to communicate better. Though she has a husband, she and her children suffered violence from him and now have a restraining order to keep themselves safe. Unfortunately, this restraining order only lasts for three months.In a letter to her teacher, she details the horrors that her husband inflicted upon her and the children. Not only did he physically assault and beat them all, but he also stole the disability support money that the children receive every month. They have experienced mental abuse from him as well, including instances of humiliation and entrapment. He keeps the children from getting an education and does not allow Yulia to have friends or make a living.The abuse against Yulia herself has been occurring for a long time, but until now she was too afraid to speak out.Her goal is to divorce her husband, but Yulia is completely broken and does not know how to proceed from here.Vision for Israel immediately gave Yulia a magnetic gift card and food baskets, toiletries, and several other items for the home. We are now preparing more items for her that she needs, more food baskets and gift cards to buy food, toys for the children, home equipment including furniture, electrical appliances, clothing, bedding, blankets, and more. All of these will be transferred to her in the coming days.It is thanks to our generous donors that we get to help people like Yulia escape from horrific situations. With God and you, our dear partners, by our side, we are able to enact His vision of love, kindness, and peace here on earth. Please consider giving what you can to this life-changing—and sometimes life-saving—cause.*Name has been changed to preserve privacy\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,On the morning of October 7th, Israel was shaken to its core. As rockets fell and terrorists crossed into our land, there were many who chose not to run—but to stay, to serve, and to save. One of them was a young paramedic named Amit.We first heard Amit’s story from Ronit Glaser, a longtime medic with Magen David Adom. She was working at the MDA command center in Jerusalem that day, after rushing her own daughters to safety through a barrage of rocket sirens.Ronit took the call from Amit just after 7 AM. Amit was trapped inside the dental clinic in Kibbutz Be’eri—one of the first communities attacked that day. She had multiple gunshot victims with her. Two were already dead. She asked Ronit calmly, “When are you coming?” In the background, Ronit could hear the gunfire.She begged her supervisor for an answer. When it came, she was heavy with sorrow as she told Amit: “You’re one of us so I’ll tell you the truth. We don’t know when we’ll get to you. We’re trying. But we can’t reach you”. Amit was in the middle of a war zone.Still, Amit remained hopeful. Hours later, she called again. In the middle of the call, one of the wounded men with her tried to flee. She stopped him, firmly but gently: “You’re not going anywhere. You’re staying with me. We don’t know what’s outside.”By then, the full tragedy had begun to unfold. Terrorists had blocked entry routes. Special forces were ambushed. Even the local MDA ambulance driver, Avi Yachatz, was gunned down—along with his two young grandsons.And Amit? She stayed.For nearly eight hours, she kept treating the wounded. She had even been shot in the leg—but managed to apply a tourniquet to herself. It wasn’t until terrorists finally breached the clinic that she was killed. She was only 22 years old.They found her two days later, once the building had been cleared of booby traps. She was still wearing her surgical gloves.Amit had been the youngest paramedic trainer in MDA. That morning, her boyfriend urged her to leave and join him somewhere safer. But she refused. “I’m on call this Shabbat,” she said. “I’m staying.”The only survivor from the clinic later told her mother: “She was my paradise in hell. She was an angel.”Stories like these are difficult to hear—but they are vital to remember. They remind us of the real heroes: those who run toward the broken and the bleeding. Those who treat the wounded even when death is near. Those who answer the call.We at Vision for Israel are humbled to stand alongside organizations like MDA—to support the very medics who serve on the frontlines of tragedy. And with your help, we can continue equipping them with ambulances, medical supplies, and protection—tools that help preserve life when every second counts.Stand with the heroes who refuse to leave the suffering behind. Give now and dedicate your gift to the Medical and emergency fund.Amit’s hands remained open until the end—offering care, hope, and life. May we be inspired to do the same, in her memory.Watch the videoWith honor and remembrance,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nOur team is working hard, now more than ever, to help the thousands of people who are arriving in Israel in need of support. So many have important, heart-wrenching stories to share, and we take the time to listen and comfort them.This is part of what we do at Vision for Israel. Our job is not only to provide physical items like backpacks, hygiene kits, and food, we also offer emotional support to the people that we help. Many of them want to tell their stories, and though all of them are important, some really stick with us. Dan Ami'el’s story is a lot like theirs.In 2004, Dan Ami'el was injured in a mortar shell attack in Kfar Darom while he was outside the synagogue, where he came to pray daily. He was only 19 years old at the time and was injured severely, to the point of near-death.Dan said, \"The immediate diagnosis was that I had a torn main artery. In such an injury it is only a matter of a minute or two until losing consciousness and death. The fact that earlier two mortar shells had fallen saved me because the standby ambulances were already in the field. If I had been hurt from the first shelling at this level of injury, the chance of saving me in time would be very slim.”While on the ambulance, Dan recounts: \"Everything was full of blood. I remember the hands being thrown around. One of the doctors was busy with the dressing, the other is trying to keep me awake at all costs and asking me dozens of times: 'Who are you? Where do you live?' There were moments when I felt extremely tired, I longed to close my eyes and fall asleep. I remember myself focusing on one of the stickers that were pasted on the side of the ambulance and reading it back and forth in a desperate attempt to stay awake. The fact that I was conscious gave doctors hope I could be saved,” he said.\"Dr. Sudi arrived and said, ‘What are you crying for? Start speaking the Psalms!’, so I started speaking the Psalms. It was an amazing thing. One moment I was reading stickers in an effort to stay awake and suddenly I found myself mumbling the Psalms.”He was transferred to the operating room in the Soroka hospital, where the director of the trauma unit operated on Dan himself. There was extensive bleeding in his body, and it was hours before he left the operating room. His doctors said, despite the surgery, his condition was still very serious and that his life was in danger. Dan was transferred to the intensive care unit at the hospital.\"While arriving at the hospital I lost consciousness. I was put straight into surgery during which I received a transfusion of 27 doses of blood. For the next two weeks, I lay unconscious and I remember dreaming a lot. I dreamed of Jews gathering in synagogues to pray for me to heal. There were many dreams about the Land of Israel and the Temple.\"During the lengthy recovery and rehabilitation trajectory, Dan was exposed to other wondrous aspects related to his miraculous rescue. \"One day the head of the trauma department came to visit me with a group of students. He starts explaining to them my injury and how I recovered. They ask him: 'How is it that he did not get shrapnel in the chest and heart area?' Then the professor points to me and says to them: 'You will learn that a tallit is a ceramic element'. My whole body was completely crushed except for the organs that had holy vessels on them. The right hand is injured and the left hand, on which the tefillin was—almost undamaged. The lower body was injured but the upper body, which was wrapped in a tallit, was not injured. The head and neck were not injured thanks to the head tefillin.”Dan returned to the scene of the injury, at the entrance to the Kfar Darom synagogue, and prayed the blessing of Hagomel. \"It was Friday. All the residents left the cooking for the Sabbath evening, stood on the steps of the synagogue, and said 'Amen’ after me. I told them: 'I went looking for a tenth for the minyan, and in the end, I found 150 people .'\"Today, Dan is a father of 6 children. His children participated in the Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebration for terror survivors that Vision for Israel sponsors. Had the Lord not intended that day, Dan and his children would not be among us today.The Lord truly blesses those who are devoted to Him. Though Dan’s experiences were terrifying, God was with him every step of the way.We ask you to help support people like Dan Ami'el and his family. When you donate to Vision for Israel, you help to make sure that people who have survived terror and warfare have the ability to live long, happy, supported lives. Please donate here.We hope this story touches your heart as much as Dan has touched our lives.May the Lord bless and keep you,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

We’re racing to deliver pre-paid debit cards to people all over Israel via registered post (for as long as the postal service remains in operation), and are stepping in to otherwise hand-deliver these important debit cards—family-by-family, house-by-house until everyone on our list has been served.\n\nAs we gather (carefully) with our loved ones this Passover, let us remember a time when God’s people were asked to take shelter in their homes to avoid serious danger.\n\nThe God of Israel protected His people against plague, pestilence, and certain death—firstly by keeping them in their homes. Then, he parted the Red Sea to rescue them from their pursuers—and to give them the chance of a better life in the Promised Land.\n\nWe recall this beautiful story every year because it has never lost its meaning to us. It’s as true today as it was then—that God will provide.\n\nLet us keep our faith, and let us keep our minds and our hearts open to what God asks of us, as we patiently wait for this global pandemic to pass over us.\n\nAs we mentioned, industry and businesses within Israel are almost at a stand-still. And over a hundred thousand Israelis are set to enter unemployment over the next 30 days. As always, we will be standing by to provide as much aid as possible to those who need it most.\n\nWould you help us in this time of special need? Your contribution could mean the world to a struggling family in Israel, to a socially-isolated Holocaust survivor, or to a child already challenged by abuse or an unstable home. Your contribution of $100 could feed a family of 5 for a week.\n\nWe are also requesting your fervent prayers for our dedicated staff here at Vision for Israel—who are standing on the front lines of this fight, dutifully carrying out these vital aid missions.\n\nFinally, we ask that you remember to be good to yourselves, and to each other. We must all take special precautions during this crisis—not only to protect our own health, but also to look after those with weakened immune systems, who are most at risk.\n\nMay the time that we all spend a little farther from each other give us the space to reflect on what is most important in life—and perhaps even bring us closer to God.\n\nMay the Lord bless you and keep you, always.\n\nIn His service,\n\nBarry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "title": "Israel at War - Time to Do MORE!",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nOn October 7, 2023 the nation of Israel suffered a severe and unbearable blow…Hamas launched around 5,000 rockets at Israel, while simultaneously infiltrating into the southern settlements of Israel. They murdered approximately 1,300 Israeli civilians and soldiers and captured over 200 hostages. Many more Israelis have gone missing or are injured.Immediately after the attack, Israel recognized that they shouldn’t just respond to this atrocity with another “operation”, but instead it was time for war! Therefore, the “Iron Swords War” was declared. The nation of Israel was surprised by this horrendous attack, devastated by the murder of many loved ones, heartbroken over those who were kidnapped, and scrambling to gather troops to get the terrorists out of their land. In the midst of all this chaos, there was also a great mobilization to help serve and care for the residents in the South of Israel and the Israeli security forces.On the first night of the war, VFI began thinking about how to mobilize people to contribute, serve, and help this nation. After all, this is our domain — support and help, especially in emergency situations.We also received many inquiries and requests for combat and emergency medical equipment, food, and other aid. We immediately started searching, recruiting, purchasing, and doing everything we could to satisfy the most urgent needs. Here are a few of the ways we were able to serve Israel during the first two weeks of the war:\n\nWe purchased around 25 sets of tactical equipment for the alert unit for the city of Sderot. The equipment includes a protective vest + 2 ceramic plates, a ballistic helmet, tactical pants and shirt, tactical gloves, tactical shoes, a headlamp, a personal flashlight, and a quality softshell jacket.\n\nWe ordered food for 200 baskets to give to families in the south. The food arrived at the Millennium Center, and several volunteers helped prepare the abundance of products for distribution to families in need.\n\nVFI's team distributed 100 food baskets to 100 families in the city of Ashkelon. This city was hit with an incessant attack of missiles and rockets. Therefore, many were afraid to leave their homes or were unable to because they couldn’t get to the shelter fast enough. These food baskets helped provide much-needed food for families, especially the elderly and those with disabilities.\n\nWe received an urgent request from a rescue organization in Judea and Samaria for the purchase of tactical medic kits. This organization is operated by volunteers: doctors, paramedics, medics, searchers, and rescuers in the field of disasters and emergencies in Israel and around the world.As they assisted in locating, rescuing, and treating hundreds of the wounded and dead, their equipment ran out. We immediately made a purchase of 100 medic kits, which included 2 types of tourniquets, bandages, a fabric triangle for immobilization, plasters, professional scissors for the medic, headlight, pads, gauze, and burn gel. In addition to these kits, we purchased 30 sets of ceramic protective vests and helmets for them as well.\n\nOn Thursday night (12.10.23), we received a call from the IDF security coordinators in the settlements surrounding Gaza. They told us they were in distress and were in great need of mattresses and blankets for the soldiers arriving at the assembly areas. The soldiers who were immediately recruited from the day the war began, had been sleeping on the hard and cold floor. The nights are getting cooler and in order for our soldiers to be strong and ready for combat, they must rest well while they can.Early Friday morning, we contacted a supplier and purchased 300 mattresses for the soldiers so that they could gain strength and sleep better. A volunteer immediately drove from the center of the country, collected the mattresses and 100 warm, new fleece blankets, and delivered them to the soldiers in the south. The soldiers were very happy and deeply thankful that we provided something for them to sleep on so quickly and efficiently.On October 17, 2023, we increased the donation and gave another 100 warm fleece blankets and 150 new towels to the soldiers.\n\nThe ZAKA organization is made up of thousands of determined volunteers who have engaged in handling, in an orderly and responsible manner, the identification of victims of terrorist attacks and disasters, and the humanitarian and halachic (Jewish Law) aspects involved in preserving the dignity of the dead.In a short time, this organization with thousands of volunteers has become an important and helpful arm in the activities of the rescue and security forces in this war. The organizational, operational, perseverant, and professional approach of ZAKA and its volunteers, who have already engaged in complex tasks in Israel and around the world, has become a byword during this time.ZAKA volunteers have been running to save as much as possible and to honor the dead when all that remains is to honor — those who have passed on and did not get to come to the grave of Israel.We received a request from ZAKA to purchase helmets and protective vests, so they can continue to locate and rescue in the field while guarding and protecting themselves under Hamas attacks. We purchased 30 sets of vests and helmets for them.\n\nWe received an inquiry from fighters who needed tactical combat equipment to protect them while fighting in the field. VFI purchased: 30 vests and magazine pouches, tactical clothing, pouches for storing ammunition, and high-quality LOWE bags.\n\nHundreds of families have been relocated, especially those living in the border cities next to Gaza. We received a request to assist a family from Sderot, which is one of the cities that has been horrifically bombarded by rockets, terrorists, murders, and abductions. One family we are helping is currently relocated to Eilat until the end of the year, and possibly longer.We know this family personally. Golan, the father, has worked with us as a photographer many times in collaboration with VFI projects in the south.Due to the difficult situation, Golan requested assistance with purchasing tablets for his children because they have to do their studies remotely. VFI made a financial donation to help with the purchase of the tablets. Golan expressed his thankfulness to VFI, and let us know that he was able to purchase the tablets for his children.This family is grateful to be relocated to a safe place and to stay in a hotel with full board. However, at the same time, Golan says that their mental state is still not good. Despite the care they are receiving, the tragic experiences and trauma of this war are still overwhelming.\n\nThe VFI team distributed 100 food baskets to Netivot, another city in the south. This city is very close to Gaza and is in the fighting zone. We met with Natalie, who is in charge of donations for the city of Netivot and is in coordination with the emergency deputy of the population complex in Netivot. As we were about 5 minutes away from delivering the food baskets to the residents of Netivot, we saw a rocket fired by Hamas explode in the city. The missile injured some residents.Those in charge and the staff who were there thanked and blessed VFI for having the courage to deliver the food baskets in the middle of the rocket firing. We were glad God protected us and that we could help these families in their time of need.\n\nLocal volunteers arrived at the Millennium Center enthusiastic and ready to serve the people of Israel, especially during a time when it needs it most. Among the volunteers are children and teens who want to participate in some way in the war effort. The volunteers helped prepare food baskets for the many residents in need in the south of Israel.\n\nWe received an urgent request from United Hatzalah for the purchase of tactical medic kits. This organization is operated by volunteers: doctors, paramedics, medics, searchers, and rescuers in the field during disasters and emergencies in Israel and around the world.On Oct. 7, when they assisted in locating, rescuing, and treating hundreds of wounded, dead, and murdered, their equipment ran out. They asked us for help and we immediately purchased 100 medic kits according to the specifications suitable for their use. Each kit includes 2 types of tourniquets, various bandages, fabric triangles for immobilization, bandaids, professional scissors for medics, a headlight, pads, gauze, and burn gel.\n\nThe VFI team distributed food baskets to families in the city of Ofakim. This city is also very close to Gaza, in the fighting zone, and is one of the areas where many families were slaughtered. The donation was given to those who are in charge of donations to soldiers and families. We delivered 100 food baskets to the families and the soldiers. When we arrived, some of the soldiers helped us bring in the donation from the vehicle.Everyone present was deeply grateful for the generous donation. Apparently, we stirred up a curiosity among the soldiers and they asked who we were. After it was explained to them, they said, \"Way to go Vision for Israel!\"\n\nThe VFI team traveled down south to the city of Ashdod to deliver 80 food baskets for families in need. Many of these families haven’t left their homes out of fear, and are having financial difficulties. It was our joy to help them practically. We delivered the food to the logistics center in Ashdod. They were very grateful for the donation and explained that the aid is very significant for the families who are in need these days.\n\nOur team arrived at Kibbutz Ma’aleh Hachamisha and visited the hotel located there. We had the honor of seeing the faces of precious families that have been evacuated from their homes due to this war. We also communicated with a representative on behalf of the heads of the settlement community and of the Home Front Command.The majority of the people at the hotel are evacuees from Nativ Ha’asara — an Israeli neighborhood right next to the Gaza border. These families suffered many losses and devastation. There were also some families from the settlement of Zikim, which is also located near the Gaza border, but fortunately, they had no losses. The hotel is at full capacity with 600 people living in almost 200 rooms. There was also a commemorative stand in the hotel for those who were murdered on October 7th — \"Black Saturday\". With heavy hearts for our people, we pray that God will comfort them with only the comfort He can bring. We were able to give them clothing for the whole family, as well as baby kits for the mothers and their newborn babies. We came to bless our fellow Israelis, and they in turn blessed us for our commitment and service. They even said it was as if a ray of sunshine came in. It was heartwarming to hear their appreciation, even for the small things.At the Neveh Ilan Hotel, we met evacuees from the Gaza envelope from Shokeda and some from the surrounding settlements. There were even a few families there that had evacuated from the north due to the growing tensions from Lebanon. We also donated clothing to these families, and it was great to see them begin choosing the clothes they needed.\n\n\"Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves receive from God.\" - 2 Corinthians 1:3-4\n\nFour volunteers arrived at the Millennium Center to pack food baskets for the families in the Gaza envelope. These volunteers served with high motivation and did an excellent job. In just a couple of hours, they prepared about 200 food baskets. Thank you to those hardworking volunteers who helped us prepare these baskets for families in Israel near the Gaza border!\n\nThe VFI team set out to help families that were evacuated from Sderot and were relocated temporarily to hotels at the Dead Sea. We met with a social worker who is in charge of taking care of all these families. The number of evacuees that were relocated to the Dead Sea is about 600 people.We provided clothes for women, men, children, and babies. We also provided diapers for the babies. We delivered the items to all of the hotels where the evacuated families are staying. They were all so happy and thanked us for the generous donations.\n\nBarry and Assaf distributed 75 food baskets and emergency aid to the families that are still inside the city of Sderot. As they drove through the city, they saw military forces everywhere and discovered that this city had become a military base.The manager of the distribution center welcomed us, and together with soldiers from the Home Front Command, we delivered the donation. They thanked us and informed us that they were also in need of toiletries like shampoo, toilet paper, and soap. We look forward to helping them with these practical needs, so they can continue to focus on fighting this war!\n\nIt has been our honor to stand with Israel in the middle of this war. We are fighting this war by practically providing food for civilians and equipping our soldiers with the supplies they need to better fight this war. Israel is at war, so it is time to do more! Join us in standing with Israel by covering this nation and people in prayer, and giving financial support to continue to meet urgent needs during this time of war.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,Welcome to our new series, Israel in Focus—short, clear teachings that bring context and truth to complex moments in Israel’s story. As we just commemorated two years since October 7, 2023, we chose to begin with it. That day—Simchat Torah on the Jewish calendar—is a holy day meant for Torah, joy, and dancing. Instead, at daybreak, Israel awoke to a coordinated, multi-front terrorist assault launched by Hamas and other terror groups from the Gaza Strip.Around 6:30 a.m., the first waves of rockets screamed into Israeli towns and cities. Within four hours, more than 3,000 rockets had been fired, forcing families into safe rooms and shelters. Under this cover of chaos, between 5,000 and 5,600 terrorists breached Israel’s southern border along a 60-kilometer front. They used tractors to tear through the separation fence, paragliders to leap over it, and arrived heavily armed with RPGs and other weapons.Twenty-nine towns and kibbutzim came under attack. Among the earliest and hardest-hit locations were the Nova festival near Kibbutz Re’im, Sderot, Kibbutz Nir Oz, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, and Kibbutz Be’eri. At the same time, twelve army positions and bases were targeted to sever communications, slow reinforcements, and leave civilians defenseless.The result was carnage. Terrorists committed atrocities against humanity—slaughter, rape, burning, destruction, and looting. For long, desperate hours, many Israeli civilians had no one to reach. Police stations and IDF units were also under fire. Families huddled in safe rooms; some were burned alive or murdered where they hid.In those first hours, the first line of defense was not the military but the local emergency response teams—neighbors and volunteers who ran toward danger to shield their communities. Only after many hours did IDF soldiers break through to the affected areas, fight building by building, and rescue those who were still alive.Among those ordinary heroes was a man whose story we carry with reverence—a brother-in-law who, by divine timing and sheer selfless courage, saved the lives of his entire extended family.That morning, as rockets thundered overhead, one family found themselves hiding in a bomb shelter in Ofakim, paralyzed with fear. But outside the door, their beloved brother-in-law, Ariel, was moving. He had seen what was coming. He had gathered weapons, taking it upon himself to defend not only his own home but theirs as well.At some point, terrorists approached. He was alone—but he stood in their path. He engaged them, firing his weapon, holding them back with nothing but his courage and determination. Because of his stand, the family was able to flee their safe room and run for their lives. Every second he bought with his resistance became a second that carried them further from death. And then, the last bullet. The last breath.He fell there, outside the shelter he had protected, but because he stood where he did, the rest of the family lived. His actions were not just brave—they were sacred. He laid down his life so that others could rise up and live. That is the kind of love no enemy can destroy.It was only hours later, after a harrowing escape, that his family learned the truth: he had remained behind. He had faced the enemy alone. And he had done it all to save them.His is just one of thousands of stories from that dark day—stories of valor, heartbreak, rescue, and loss. But it helps us see the reality behind the headlines: that each statistic is a soul, each tragedy a family.In the days immediately following, Israel’s south became a landscape of grief and grit—burned homes, shattered windows, abandoned vehicles amid fields of ash. Evacuated families arrived in unfamiliar hotel rooms with little more than the clothes they wore. Children woke to nightmares, flinching at every slam of a door. Parents tried to be strong while making impossible phone calls, waiting for news of loved ones, and navigating a maze of emergency needs.Here is the stark toll of that day:• 251 people taken hostage• 1,697 murdered• 19,019 injured• 143,000 evacuated from their homes• 300,000 reserve soldiers called upThis is where the compassion of God’s people, expressed through practical help, makes all the difference. At Vision for Israel, we mobilized our team and partners to meet urgent needs for the displaced and the bereaved. Working from our logistics center, The Millennium Center, we assembled and distributed relief packages with hygiene items, food staples, clothing, bedding, and baby supplies to families who had lost everything. We provided store vouchers so parents could choose essentials with dignity. We supported trauma-care initiatives for children and families, helping them begin the long journey of healing with counseling, safe activities, and tools to process fear and grief.We also helped equip first responders and community emergency teams with protective gear and essentials, and we assisted evacuees as they resettled—supplying school materials for displaced students, and ongoing food support as the weeks stretched into months. During the fall feasts and beyond, we have been delivering gift cards and comfort items to remind families that they were seen, remembered, and loved.Your prayers and partnership turned compassion into action. Each box delivered, each gift card placed into a parent’s hands, each hour of trauma support—these are seeds of restoration. When the world seemed to fracture on October 7, the body of Messiah bound up the wounds, one act of mercy at a time.As we remember October 7, we ask you to keep praying for the release of the hostages who have been held captive for over 2 years. We also recommit to healing what was shattered—homes, hearts, and hope. If your heart is stirred to stand with Israel in this season of rebuilding, your gift will bring practical help and real comfort to survivors, children, and families still carrying the weight of that day.Give today to provide urgent aid, trauma care, and long-term support.Chag Sukkot Same’ach!With gratitude,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",
      "content_html": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\" style=\"color:white\">Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War</p><p>Dear Friends,<br/><br/>Welcome to our new series, Israel in Focus—short, clear teachings that bring context and truth to complex moments in Israel’s story. As we just commemorated two years since October 7, 2023, we chose to begin with it. That day—Simchat Torah on the Jewish calendar—is a holy day meant for Torah, joy, and dancing. Instead, at daybreak, Israel awoke to a coordinated, multi-front terrorist assault launched by Hamas and other terror groups from the Gaza Strip.<br/><br/>Around 6:30 a.m., the first waves of rockets screamed into Israeli towns and cities. Within four hours, more than 3,000 rockets had been fired, forcing families into safe rooms and shelters. Under this cover of chaos, between 5,000 and 5,600 terrorists breached Israel’s southern border along a 60-kilometer front. They used tractors to tear through the separation fence, paragliders to leap over it, and arrived heavily armed with RPGs and other weapons.<br/><br/>Twenty-nine towns and kibbutzim came under attack. Among the earliest and hardest-hit locations were the Nova festival near Kibbutz Re’im, Sderot, Kibbutz Nir Oz, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, and Kibbutz Be’eri. At the same time, twelve army positions and bases were targeted to sever communications, slow reinforcements, and leave civilians defenseless.<br/><br/>The result was carnage. Terrorists committed atrocities against humanity—slaughter, rape, burning, destruction, and looting. For long, desperate hours, many Israeli civilians had no one to reach. Police stations and IDF units were also under fire. Families huddled in safe rooms; some were burned alive or murdered where they hid.<br/><br/>In those first hours, the first line of defense was not the military but the local emergency response teams—neighbors and volunteers who ran toward danger to shield their communities. Only after many hours did IDF soldiers break through to the affected areas, fight building by building, and rescue those who were still alive.<br/><br/>Among those ordinary heroes was a man whose story we carry with reverence—a brother-in-law who, by divine timing and sheer selfless courage, saved the lives of his entire extended family.<br/><br/>That morning, as rockets thundered overhead, one family found themselves hiding in a bomb shelter in Ofakim, paralyzed with fear. But outside the door, their beloved brother-in-law, Ariel, was moving. He had seen what was coming. He had gathered weapons, taking it upon himself to defend not only his own home but theirs as well.<br/><br/>At some point, terrorists approached. He was alone—but he stood in their path. He engaged them, firing his weapon, holding them back with nothing but his courage and determination. Because of his stand, the family was able to flee their safe room and run for their lives. Every second he bought with his resistance became a second that carried them further from death. And then, the last bullet. The last breath.<br/><br/>He fell there, outside the shelter he had protected, but because he stood where he did, the rest of the family lived. His actions were not just brave—they were sacred. He laid down his life so that others could rise up and live. That is the kind of love no enemy can destroy.<br/><br/>It was only hours later, after a harrowing escape, that his family learned the truth: he had remained behind. He had faced the enemy alone. And he had done it all to save them.<br/><br/>His is just one of thousands of stories from that dark day—stories of valor, heartbreak, rescue, and loss. But it helps us see the reality behind the headlines: that each statistic is a soul, each tragedy a family.<br/><br/>In the days immediately following, Israel’s south became a landscape of grief and grit—burned homes, shattered windows, abandoned vehicles amid fields of ash. Evacuated families arrived in unfamiliar hotel rooms with little more than the clothes they wore. Children woke to nightmares, flinching at every slam of a door.

Our volunteers enthusiastically served these families who were displaced due to the war by preparing more than 100 food baskets for them.\n\nLater that day, a mother and her son volunteered their time to serve together. They sorted and prepared clothes for all ages for the evacuees from the south.\n\nThe VFI team set out to deliver clothing to about 360 families evacuated from the Gaza envelope to a hotel in Netanya. Some of the families are from Ibim in the south and some were evacuated from Kiryat Shmonah in the north. When we arrived, we were warmly welcomed by the family manager and the hotel manager. We not only had the honour to deliver the donation of clothes for the whole family and toys for the children, but we also had the honour of personally meeting some of the families. We were able to encourage them and help provide some of their basic needs during such a challenging time. The representatives and families were very grateful for the generous donation, and they thanked and blessed us.\n\nRecently we received a special request from soldiers in a combat sector in the north of Israel. They needed help purchasing softshell jackets, which are wind/rain repellent jackets according to the army's standards.\n\nThe season is changing and the nights, especially in the north, are getting very cold. These jackets are very important since it is becoming increasingly important to keep the soldiers warm and in good health.\n\nThere are many benefits to soft-shell jackets — they are lightweight, have high resistance to weather elements, don’t absorb dirt and moisture, are very resistant to rain, are suitable for stormy weather, and can be worn over thermal jerseys, uniforms, and various types of special clothing. They also provide more freedom of movement when the soldiers are in the field.\n\nThe elite army officer personally collected the 32 jackets from us. Each was according to the sizes that were needed for his soldiers.\n\nBatya and Barry along with the VFI team, went to Yeruham for an introductory meeting with the head of the local council. They were able to get a better picture of the needs of the displaced families that are now living in Yeruham.\n\nThat day we delivered 52 food baskets, towels, duvets, and fleece blankets, a first aid kit, and clothing packages for families evacuated from the Ashkelon, Netivot, and other Gaza envelope areas, as well as families who are in need in Yeruham.\n\nThe head of the local council and the social services team were grateful. They thanked us for the donations and the future cooperation with Vision for Israel.\n\nWe purchased first aid kits for rescue units that do invaluable work every day. Especially during the war, they have provided care day and night for the citizens of Israel, the security forces, and soldiers.\n\nThanks to our donors’ generous donations, we were able to give 100 first-aid medic kits with contents according to the standard for use in an emergency to a representative of United Hatzala. These first-aid kits will be used by the medics and paramedics of United Hatzalah. This donation was in addition to 100 tactical medic kits that were donated over two weeks ago.\n\nEven the youth of Israel are stepping up during this time to help our fellow citizens. A young 16-year-old girl named Noyah, who lives in Modi’in, got in touch with us for a special request. The 11th grader is an ambassador in the LEAD Team Jerusalem program and oversees the project \"A Bag Full of Love\". From the beginning of the war, this project has been collecting school supplies for kids displaced by the war who are staying in a guest house in the settlement of Maccabim, as well as in host homes with families in Modi'in.\n\nThe children were integrated with the cooperation of the Modi’in municipality and the Department of Social Services into the local schools. This helps the kids return to somewhat of a routine, meet with friends their age, and disconnect a little from the harsh reality of being evacuated from their homes.\n\nVision for Israel immediately got involved and purchased, at their request, 26 calculators and 10 headphones to be used by middle school and high school students.ael immediately got involved and purchased, at their request, 26 calculators and 10 headphones to be used by middle school and high school students.\n\nOur faithful team distributed food baskets to 80 families in the city of Ashdod. This is the second time that we have helped families in the city of Ashdod. This city had been heavily targeted by rockets from Gaza during the Swords of Iron War. Most of the families in Ashdod are no longer working, and therefore many are in dire financial situations.The food baskets were delivered to the representatives of welfare for families in Ashdod. These representatives shared with us the great need for aid with food baskets, gift cards, and more for the people in this city during this time. They thanked us for helping the families and people in Ashdod.\n\nMany families in Israel had to evacuate their homes in the Gaza envelope, and are now relocated to different temporary living situations all over the country. These families had to escape the conflict lines where the war was more intense. Because of this, many have had to stop working. Due to the war, there is a high percentage of families in need throughout the country, including Rishon LeZion. The residents of this city have definitely felt the effects of this war because they have suffered from frequent rocket attacks, and one rocket even hit a home.Our VFI team distributed food packages to 100 welfare families in the city of Rishon LeZion. This city is quite large with many people in need, so we had to deliver the packages two days in a row to cover three different areas within the city. The packages were handed over to the welfare department representatives who expressed the dire need of the families and made sure to deliver the aid to the families in need.\n\nOur VFI team traveled to Ashkelon to deliver food baskets to show the residents our support during this difficult time of war. We gave 80 food baskets, which included basic food products and dry products like rice, coffee, flour, oil, etc.The city of Ashkelon was hit by many rocket barrages in these last two months that completely shook the residents. Most of the residents were evacuated, but not all were entitled to assistance from the state, so they had to remain in the city and were on constant alert.The war greatly affected the businesses and routines in the city, and the residents who remained there were in a mental and financial crisis. Therefore, any assistance is beneficial. The municipality of Ashkelon together with the welfare department established several food distribution centers as well as additional assistance according to the needs of the residents. A team of volunteers from outside the city, along with residents of Ashkelon help serve the community there.The remains of a rocket still lay in the courtyard of their community center where the volunteers and workers were serving. We can’t even imagine what they have gone through. When we arrived, we were greeted by the person responsible for the volunteers and distribution there. Everyone we met, blessed VFI and said that each food basket was a breath of fresh air for the families.\n\nBarry received a request from another organization to help them purchase softshell jackets for 500 soldiers serving in elite units in the north and south of Israel.Due to the stormy winter weather that arrived in Israel, we felt an urgency to immediately distribute the majority of the jackets. So far, we gave 240 jackets to the soldiers in the north and 100 jackets to the soldiers in the south. The rest of the jackets will be distributed in the coming days.These jackets help ensure that the soldiers in the field maintain their health, and stay strong, warm, and well-equipped. We are grateful for the willing volunteers that we managed to recruit on short notice. They helped deliver the jackets to two different areas in the north and an area close to the Gaza Strip in the south.The soldiers were grateful and thanked Vision for Israel and the donors for their generous and practical gift.\n\nWe got to know Hezi and his daughters from attending different events with the Organization for Victims of Hostilities several years ago. Hezi is divorced and has two daughters. He is a devoted father even when he is not physically with them. Hezi is a resident of Sderot and his ex-wife and daughters live in a kibbutz nearby. These areas are right on the border of Gaza, and they experienced excruciating and severe trauma from the events of October 7.Hezi and one of his daughters came to the Millennium Center to receive technology to help them pursue their studies. Hezi received a laptop to help him start his education studies (he currently works in the prison service), and his two daughters received iPads to help them study remotely. We also gave them two gift cards so they can buy coats for the winter and additional clothing they need.\n\nGolan is a photographer who has worked with us on various projects over the last few years. His family lives in Sderot, and they are survivors of the terrible massacre on October 7, 2023.In October, we purchased two tablets for two of his daughters. Today, Golan received a professional laptop, bag, and mouse. With this gift, he will be able to install the special software he works with and be able to gradually return to work. This will help him create a healthy routine, get out from time to time, and get back to work.Golan and his family have been relocated to Eilat until the end of January 2024. His daughters attend schools there that were set up by the municipality for the evacuees of Sderot in cooperation with the Ministry of Education.Today, for the first time since the onset of the war, Golan went to work in Jerusalem. He came to visit us and was very excited to see us, despite all of the fears, nightmares, and worries he suffers from.\n\nWe received a request from friends of ours to supply radios for the emergency squad of Kibbutz Degania B. This kibbutz is located in the north of Israel, about 3 km from the border with Jordan, and has 700 residents.Due to the war, about 300 residents have been relocated from their homes in other communities near the border of Lebanon to the kibbutz. When we arrived, we were pleasantly welcomed and were treated to a coffee in the small, yet homey cafe of the kibbutz. The VFI team met the military security coordinator of the kibbutz, and we gave him the 2-way radio devices that we had purchased for the emergency squad. There are 40 residents who volunteer in the emergency squad.The donation included 24 portable radios, 24 microphones/speakers, and two stationary devices for the security vehicle and the HQ. The squad greatly appreciated our involvement in helping, and they were happy and excited about our support at this time.In the past, there have been several infiltration attempts into this kibbutz from Jordan. These Israelis are aware that the Jordanians are training because they can hear them, but they don't know for what purpose. It is relatively quiet at the moment and we hope it will stay this way. However, we want them to be prepared for any scenario.\n\nToday, we brought clothing to several hotels in Jerusalem to families who were evacuated from their homes in both the north and south of Israel. As we were in contact with those responsible for these families, we could see and feel the great needs of the people firsthand. In one of the hotels, there are about 100 evacuees who are mainly from the north (Kiryat Shmona and Shlomi) and a few from Ashkelon. There are about 20 children of all ages. However, the majority of the evacuees at the hotel are elderly. The main need of this elderly population is for volunteers to escort them to the hospital or clinics since they are unfamiliar with the area. They also need someone to help them receive their full rights as they deal with all the bureaucracy.The welfare department and the municipality were greatly touched by VFI’s desire to help these families in a practical and thoughtful way. And they also expressed that it would be helpful if we were able to provide an activity for the elderly.\n\nAssaf and Yoni distributed 80 food baskets to families in need in the city of Ofakim. When they arrived in Ofakim, they met the person in charge of the municipality's warehouse, who is also the deputy director of the municipality. He expressed the great need for these food baskets because of the many families in need in Ofakim. The aid is very helpful to the residents because of the economic hardships that the war has brought to the southern communities in Israel. The representative blessed Vision for Israel for their generous donation. And we, in turn, want to say, “THANK YOU” to you our generous donors! Thank you for making this work possible and for blessing the nation of Israel, especially in a time of great need during this war.\n\nFollowing the distributions carried out on Nov. 20, the VFI team distributed jackets to our soldiers in two additional locations. The first distribution was at the Matan settlement in Samaria, where we gave 66 softshell jackets to soldiers. And in the second location, we gave 117 jackets to soldiers at an outpost near Mt. Hermon.In Matan, the soldiers are protecting the area of settlements that are adjacent to the separation fence next to the West Bank. The soldiers stationed there are reserve fighters from different units and brigades, and they have been there for two months now. Many volunteers are helping the IDF, due to the war and the many different areas Israel needs to protect.The soldiers were very thankful for the assistance they received from VFI and told us how important this donation is for them, and how much it will help them. As we told them of the support of the IDF from people all around the world, they were deeply touched! We want to say “THANK YOU” to our donors for your generous hearts and vital support to Israel at this time!The second army base is near the north border of Israel at the foot of Mount Hermon. Since these soldiers are located at one of the highest points in the country, they are the first to experience very cold weather in Israel. The reserve soldiers stationed there are from the Golani Brigade. Their battalion was mobilized since the beginning of the war, and they are on defensive activity on the northern border.Amazingly, the morale of these soldiers is high despite the difficulties of the war. They are in an atmosphere of unity and try to stay positive despite the pressure and challenges. The soldiers said that the north border next to Syria is not easy, especially because of the low temperatures reaching 3 to 4 C this time of year. As the winter progresses, the temperature will drop and could even reach minus 10 C.We could feel their excitement as they received the jackets and thanked VFI. Their eagerness to receive a jacket was like someone who found gold! We are so grateful to be able to provide a basic need that will help these soldiers continue to protect the northern border of Israel.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe Torah is like a river with a strong undercurrent that unites its seemingly independent parts to produce a consistent, central theme. Each parashah leads into the next like a logical train of thought ensuring that juxtaposed details and narratives, as unrelated as they may seem, are actually more related than they appear. That is why Yeshua and the apostles were readily able to identify the Torah’s overarching theme:\n\nIn everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want them to treat you, for this is the Law and the Prophets (Mat. 7:12)\n\nIdeally speaking, the thread that weaves each Torah portion to the next also accompanies us as we go about our business during the week. Each parashah is divided into seven aliyahs, corresponding to the seven days of the week. Theoretically, it is possible to enter each Shabbat in sync with the rhythm and pulse of the Torah’s themes for a given week. As participants “in the world but not of it,” it is important to establish regular times of Torah study. A practical way to achieve this is to read one aliyah, or one section, of the Torah portion each day.\n\nThis week’s Torah portion is Parashat Korach (Numbers 16:1-18:32) which is named after the individual responsible for instigating the most famous insurrection against Moses and Aaron. According to the narrative, Korach, a distinguished priest from the foremost Levitical family of the Koathites, accuses Moses of establishing himself as the supreme leader in Israel and practicing nepotism by appointing his brother, Aaron, as Israel’s high priest. Korach’s argument is simple: “All Israel is holy, and God is among them,” so Moses shouldn’t exalt himself above the LORD’s assembly (Numbers 16:3).Not to be outdone, two Reubenites from an adjacent camp, Dathan and Abiram, capitalize on the crisis and level their own grievance against Moses, accusing the supposed self-appointed leader of bringing the Israelites out of Egypt only to exterminate them in the desert (Numbers 16:12-14). Their argument is consistent with the national disapproval we read about in last week’s portion of the ordeal of the Twelve Spies, who discouraged the people with an evil report and in turn, refused to ascend to the Promised Land. This week, Dathan and Abiram protest:\n\nEven if you had brought us to a land flowing with milk and honey, and given us possession of fields and vineyards, should you gouge out the eyes of those involved? We will not go up!” (Num. 16:14)\n\nTogether with Korach, Dathan, and Abiram insight 250 of Israel’s leaders to square off against Moses by approaching the Tabernacle with their own incense and censers (vv. 16-19). In the end, Moses is vindicated by God’s appearance, the rebellion is squashed, and the ground opens to swallow Korach, as well as Dathan and Abiram and their families, and their entire possessions.Lessons abound in Parshat Korach about communal strife and personal conduct when dealing with a dispute. And for that reason, it is easy to see why Parashat Korach has been read as an admonition for centuries. As a matter of fact, the New Testament provides a stark warning about the subversive division in the body of Messiah and offers Korach as an example to avoid:\n\nWoe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion. (Jude 1:10-11)\n\nIt is apparent that Korach’s example is intended to serve as an everlasting reminder for all believers. Whatever Korah did was not good, and disciples of Yeshua still have to be on guard against such divisive behavior even today! That is why Jude writes in earlier verses:\n\nBecause certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you (v. 4)… these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries (v. 8)… [they] speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves (v. 10).\n\nThese testimonies and more are among the many reasons Korach is remembered, and his insurrection studied as an admonition for the ages. However, as unholy as this individual may seem, we must remember that there is an overall theme that is woven into each verse of the Torah – a motif so strong that the thematic link between the first verse of a parashah (which often contains a word representing the title), and the last verse is stronger than the end of any one portion and the beginning of the next. That leads us to consider the legacy of Korach: How is it appropriate that an entire Torah portion is named after him? And if the central theme of the Torah portion is Korach, then what does that teach us about the bulk of our parashah which largely seems to have nothing to do with him?\n\nAfter thwarting the insurrection, God confirms Aaron in the priesthood and provides additional legislation regarding priestly and Levitical privileges and responsibilities. In chapter 17, we read the famous passage where God instructs the twelve leaders of the tribes of Israel to write their names on their staff and to place them before the Ark of the Covenant in the Tabernacle. Overnight, Aaron’s staff – which represented the tribe of Levi – budded, blossomed, and produced almonds. Thus, confirming God’s selection.Legends abound concerning the Rod of Aaron, and the Torah mentions that after the other eleven staffs were removed, Aaron’s staff was returned to the Tabernacle and placed before the Ark as a warning against the rebels (Num. 17:10-11). The Book of Hebrews asserts that the Staff of Aaron was placed inside the Ark itself, along with a golden pot of manna and the tablets of the covenant (Heb. 9:4). The midrashic traditions attest to its redemptive and messianic qualities, explaining that the same staff was given as a scepter to the Davidic kings until the destruction of Solomon’s Temple and that although it has since been lost, it will be returned again to king Messiah upon his coming as a symbol of his authority over the wicked.On the surface, it would appear that none of these things have anything to do with Korach; however, because this section of Scripture is included in the pericope dealing with Korach, we know that somehow this is all related to his legacy.\n\nThe Book of Proverbs assures us of the fate of the ungodly and the longevity of the memory of the righteous:\n\nThe name of the righteous is invoked in blessing, But the name of the wicked will rot (Prov. 10:7).\n\nWe take this to mean that the name of the wicked will be forgotten or blotted out. As a matter of fact, Talmudic tradition teaches, “Their names shall decay for we do not mention (the wicked) by name.” This principle is most notably demonstrated in the communal reading of the Megillah (Scroll of Esther) each year at Purim, where it is customary to drown out the mention of Haman’s name with boos. If the same principle were justly applied to Korach, it would seem counterintuitive to recall an entire section of Scripture by his name.It is notable that there is no indication of righteousness in Korach’s name itself. Nevertheless, his name lives on in biblical memory - and naming a Torah portion after him is only the tip of the iceberg!Korach’s name and legacy are perpetuated in many places throughout Scripture, primarily through the lives of his children. This should make us pause and consider: Didn’t the ground swallow up all the rebels and their children? That was certainly true of Dathan and Abiram, but that was not the fate of Korach’s descendants (Num. 16:27).In fact, a number of the compositions in the Book of Psalms are attributed to his sons (Ps. chs. 42-49, 84, 85, 87, 88). Elsewhere we learn that Korach merited to be a forerunner to the prophet Samuel (1 Chr. 6:3-15), one of Israel’s most notable prophets. Considering that the majority of the Psalms are attributed to King David and the sons of Korach, not to mention that the prophet who would ultimately anoint David as Israel’s king is Korach’s direct descendant, it is alarming that Korach’s name and King David are even mentioned in the same breath! But they are, and favorably so. These details could lead one to speculate that perhaps Korach was not the villain that he would appear to be.Make no mistake, there is no saving grace for Korach although he had the privilege of fathering righteous children. Whereas his progeny repented, Korach did not. Nevertheless, the fact that Korach’s punishment did not extend to his children may be indicative of his intentions. While his judgment was misguided, he wasn’t entirely insincere whereas Dathan and Abiram actively sought out a pretense to oppose Moses.\n\nKorach’s dispute is accompanied by several peculiarities. On the one hand, it appears that he was set against the institution of the priesthood itself: “Everyone is holy and God is among them.” On the other hand, it is apparent that Korach and his followers sought the priesthood for themselves, as Moses explicitly states:\n\nIs it not enough for you that the God of Israel has set you apart from the community of Israel and given you access to him, to perform the duties of the LORD’s tabernacle and to minister to the community and serve them? Now that He has advanced you and all your fellow Levites with you, do you seek the priesthood too? (vv. 9-10)\n\nIn truth, Korach was not so double minded and he was much more calculated than he appears. As a wealthy and educated leader of the Koathite family, he held a prestigious role as the foremost handler of the Tabernacle’s sacred objects (Num. 4:4-20). Having experience and proximity to the holiest items in the Sanctuary, he was more than knowledgeable in the facilitation of the Temple service. The fact that he was able to persuade a host of influential leaders and fund the distribution of 250 incense censers is also a testament to his wealth and charisma. But he was not eligible because God entrusted the office to Aaron and his descendants. It is possible that Korach sincerely believed that he was justified in his cause, that he would elevate the priestly office, and that he alone would be vindicated before God in the trial of the accusers. Whatever the case, it is apparent from his own words that Korach opposed Moses and questioned his qualifications to hold executive authority. It is also apparent from Moses’ rebuttal that Korach sought the office of High Priest for himself.In the ancient Aramaic translation of Numbers 16:1, the opening words of our Torah portion, the phrase, “Korach took,” is translated as “Korach divided” (Targum Onkelos). To understand the intent behind the translation we must first comprehend that there are distinctions among the various sacred roles within the social fabric of Israel: For example, the primary difference between the kohanim (priests) and commoners was that the kohanim were withdrawn from the secular world and totally occupied with maintaining the sanctity of their office. This is especially true of the Kohen Gadol (High priest) to whom Korach’s accusation was levied. Concerning the High Priest, the Torah says the following:\n\nHe shall not go outside the sanctuary and profane the sanctuary of his God, for upon him is the distinction of the anointing oil of his God… (Lev. 21:12).\n\nThe Kohen Gadol had a specific vocation and carried a level of personal sanctity that did not allow him to mingle with the common people during his service. Korach certainly had this distinction in mind when he contended, “Why do you [Moses] elevate yourself above the people?”However, there is one important aspect of the High Priest’s function that Korach overlooked: Just because Aaron was not permitted to leave the sanctuary and associate with the people did not mean that he was uninvolved in their lives. As a matter of fact, we read an inspiring account of Aaron’s service as he provides a remedy for the accusers who are dying as a result of their confrontational service:\n\nAaron took it, as Moses had ordered, and ran to the midst of the community, where the plague had begun among the people. He put on the incense and made atonement for the people; he stood between the dead and the living until the plague was checked (Num. 16:47-48).”\n\nContrary to Korach’s assessment, Aaron and every subsequent High Priest carried a unique burden in how they functioned on behalf of the people. As intercessors and mediators before God on the people’s behalf, they figuratively and quite literally stood between the living and the dead. Part of the responsibility of Kohen Gadol was to draw the people up to his own level of holiness by inspiring them, sanctifying them, and elevating them through the example of his personal conduct. However, Korach did not perceive this responsibility in correspondence to the unlimited potential of the nation. He only saw the distinction and the separation between priest and nation.When studied in this light, it is easy to see the inconsistency in Korach’s claim. Part of his argument was true, “all Israel is holy,” as Scripture states concerning her: “but you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation (Ex. 19:6).” However, Korach’s failure came as a result of his inability to see those distinct functions as a single entity, edifying each other and working together to sanctify God’s name in the world. Along those lines, the apostle Peter reminds us that despite our diversity and distinct callings, we are “being built into a spiritual house to be priests set apart for God to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to him through Yeshua the Messiah (1 Peter 2:5 CJB).”\n\nAlthough part of Korach’s mistake was in assuming that the commoners had as much right and honor as the High Priest, the division he brought into the community had the effect of strengthening the office of the High Priest. In the end, we read about the budding of Aaron’s staff and the 24 priestly gifts that follow in chapters 17 and 18. As previously mentioned, these divine demonstrations produced a sign in Israel of Messianic proportions. Furthermore, its results and the midrashic and prophetic notion that Aaron’s rod should serve not only as affirmation of his priesthood, but also as the scepter of Israel’s monarchy, aligns well with the picture the Book of Hebrews paints about Yeshua as a messianic figure who ultimately unites Israel’s most sacred offices, just as Moses functioned for a time as Israel’s de facto king, prophet, and high priest (see Deut. 18:18).Herein lies the connection between the first and last verses of our Torah portion. Although Korach represents division and the Torah represents ideals that strive for unity and mutual love, the union that Torah brings comes not in spite of, but through, the medium of division. Just as we see at Creation - the division of waters and the separation of light and darkness - these things precipitate the goodness and blessing that God showers on the earth. In the same way, Israel’s most sacred offices must come with distinction in order to find solidarity and fullness with the coming of the Messiah at the final redemption. The same can be said of Korach. His division was a precondition to strengthening the priestly covenant and securing its validation. Thus, the name of Korach, for better or for worse, is remembered in Scripture.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

According to the narrative, Korach, a distinguished priest from the foremost Levitical family of the Koathites, accuses Moses of establishing himself as the supreme leader in Israel and practicing nepotism by appointing his brother, Aaron, as Israel’s high priest. Korach’s argument is simple: “All Israel is holy, and God is among them,” so Moses shouldn’t exalt himself above the LORD’s assembly (Numbers 16:3).<br/><br/>Not to be outdone, two Reubenites from an adjacent camp, Dathan and Abiram, capitalize on the crisis and level their own grievance against Moses, accusing the supposed self-appointed leader of bringing the Israelites out of Egypt only to exterminate them in the desert (Numbers 16:12-14). Their argument is consistent with the national disapproval we read about in last week’s portion of the ordeal of the Twelve Spies, who discouraged the people with an evil report and in turn, refused to ascend to the Promised Land. This week, Dathan and Abiram protest:</p><p><em>Even if you had brought us to a land flowing with milk and honey, and given us possession of fields and vineyards, should you gouge out the eyes of those involved? We will not go up!” (Num. 16:14)</em></p><p>Together with Korach, Dathan, and Abiram insight 250 of Israel’s leaders to square off against Moses by approaching the Tabernacle with their own incense and censers (vv. 16-19). In the end, Moses is vindicated by God’s appearance, the rebellion is squashed, and the ground opens to swallow Korach, as well as Dathan and Abiram and their families, and their entire possessions.<br/><br/>Lessons abound in <em>Parshat Korach </em>about communal strife and personal conduct when dealing with a dispute. And for that reason, it is easy to see why <em>Parashat Korach </em>has been read as an admonition for centuries. As a matter of fact, the New Testament provides a stark warning about the subversive division in the body of Messiah and offers Korach as an example to avoid:</p><p><em>Woe to them! They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; </em><strong><em>they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion.</em> </strong>(Jude 1:10-11)</p><p>It is apparent that Korach’s example is intended to serve as an everlasting reminder for all believers. Whatever Korah did was not good, and disciples of Yeshua still have to be on guard against such divisive behavior even today! That is why Jude writes in earlier verses:</p><p><em>Because certain individuals whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you (v. 4)… these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries (v. 8)… [they] speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves (v. 10).</em></p><p>These testimonies and more are among the many reasons Korach is remembered, and his insurrection studied as an admonition for the ages. However, as unholy as this individual may seem, we must remember that there is an overall theme that is woven into each verse of the Torah – a motif so strong that the thematic link between the first verse of a parashah (which often contains a word representing the title), and the last verse is stronger than the end of any one portion and the beginning of the next. That leads us to consider the legacy of Korach: How is it appropriate that an entire Torah portion is named after him? And if the central theme of the Torah portion is Korach, then what does that teach us about the bulk of our parashah which largely seems to have nothing to do with him?</p><p>After thwarting the insurrection, God confirms Aaron in the priesthood and provides additional legislation regarding priestly and Levitical privileges and responsibilities. In chapter 17, we read the famous passage where God instructs the twelve leaders of the tribes of Israel to write their names on their staff and to place them before the Ark of the Covenant in the Tabernacle. Overnight, Aaron’s staff – which represented the tribe of Levi – budded, blossomed, and produced almonds. Thus, confirming God’s selection.<br/><br/>Legends abound concerning the Rod of Aaron, and the Torah mentions that after the other eleven staffs were removed, Aaron’s staff was returned to the Tabernacle and placed before the Ark as a warning against the rebels (Num. 17:10-11). The Book of Hebrews asserts that the Staff of Aaron was placed inside the Ark itself, along with a golden pot of manna and the tablets of the covenant (Heb. 9:4). The midrashic traditions attest to its redemptive and messianic qualities, explaining that the same staff was given as a scepter to the Davidic kings until the destruction of Solomon’s Temple and that although it has since been lost, it will be returned again to king Messiah upon his coming as a symbol of his authority over the wicked.<br/><br/>On the surface, it would appear that none of these things have anything to do with Korach; however, because this section of Scripture is included in the pericope dealing with Korach, we know that somehow this is all related to his legacy.</p><p>The Book of Proverbs assures us of the fate of the ungodly and the longevity of the memory of the righteous:</p><p><em>The name of the righteous is invoked in blessing, But the name of the wicked will rot</em> (Prov. 10:7).</p><p>We take this to mean that the name of the wicked will be forgotten or blotted out. As a matter of fact, Talmudic tradition teaches, “<em>Their names shall decay for we do not mention (the wicked) by name.</em>” This principle is most notably demonstrated in the communal reading of the Megillah (Scroll of Esther) each year at Purim, where it is customary to drown out the mention of Haman’s name with boos. If the same principle were justly applied to Korach, it would seem counterintuitive to recall an entire section of Scripture by his name.<br/><br/>It is notable that there is no indication of righteousness in Korach’s name itself. Nevertheless, his name lives on in biblical memory - and naming a Torah portion after him is only the tip of the iceberg!<br/><br/>Korach’s name and legacy are perpetuated in many places throughout Scripture, primarily through the lives of his children. This should make us pause and consider: Didn’t the ground swallow up all the rebels and their children? That was certainly true of Dathan and Abiram, but that was not the fate of Korach’s descendants (Num. 16:27).<br/><br/>In fact, a number of the compositions in the Book of Psalms are attributed to his sons (Ps. chs. 42-49, 84, 85, 87, 88). Elsewhere we learn that Korach merited to be a forerunner to the prophet Samuel (1 Chr. 6:3-15), one of Israel’s most notable prophets. Considering that the majority of the Psalms are attributed to King David and the sons of Korach, not to mention that the prophet who would ultimately anoint David as Israel’s king is Korach’s direct descendant, it is alarming that Korach’s name and King David are even mentioned in the same breath! But they are, and favorably so. These details could lead one to speculate that perhaps Korach was not the villain that he would appear to be.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, there is no saving grace for Korach although he had the privilege of fathering righteous children. Whereas his progeny repented, Korach did not. Nevertheless, the fact that Korach’s punishment did not extend to his children may be indicative of his intentions. While his judgment was misguided, he wasn’t entirely insincere whereas Dathan and Abiram actively sought out a pretense to oppose Moses. </p><p>Korach’s dispute is accompanied by several peculiarities. On the one hand, it appears that he was set against the institution of the priesthood itself: “<em>Everyone is holy and God is among them.</em>” On the other hand, it is apparent that Korach and his followers sought the priesthood for themselves, as Moses explicitly states:</p><p><em>Is it not enough for you that the God of Israel has set you apart from the community of Israel and given you access to him, to perform the duties of the LORD’s tabernacle and to minister to the community and serve them? Now that He has advanced you and all your fellow Levites with you, </em><strong><em>do you seek the priesthood too?</em> </strong>(vv. 9-10)</p><p>In truth, Korach was not so double minded and he was much more calculated than he appears. As a wealthy and educated leader of the Koathite family, he held a prestigious role as the foremost handler of the Tabernacle’s sacred objects (Num. 4:4-20). Having experience and proximity to the holiest items in the Sanctuary, he was more than knowledgeable in the facilitation of the Temple service. The fact that he was able to persuade a host of influential leaders and fund the distribution of 250 incense censers is also a testament to his wealth and charisma. But he was not eligible because God entrusted the office to Aaron and his descendants. It is possible that Korach sincerely believed that he was justified in his cause, that he would elevate the priestly office, and that he alone would be vindicated before God in the trial of the accusers. Whatever the case, it is apparent from his own words that Korach opposed Moses and questioned his qualifications to hold executive authority. It is also apparent from Moses’ rebuttal that Korach sought the office of High Priest for himself.<br/><br/>In the ancient Aramaic translation of Numbers 16:1, the opening words of our Torah portion, the phrase, “Korach took,” is translated as “Korach divided” (Targum Onkelos). To understand the intent behind the translation we must first comprehend that there are distinctions among the various sacred roles within the social fabric of Israel: For example, the primary difference between the <em>kohanim</em> (priests) and commoners was that the kohanim were withdrawn from the secular world and totally occupied with maintaining the sanctity of their office. This is especially true of the <em>Kohen Gadol</em> (High priest) to whom Korach’s accusation was levied. Concerning the High Priest, the Torah says the following:</p><p><em>He shall not go outside the sanctuary and profane the sanctuary of his God, for upon him is the distinction of the anointing oil of his God… </em>(Lev. 21:12).</p><p>The Kohen Gadol had a specific vocation and carried a level of personal sanctity that did not allow him to mingle with the common people during his service. Korach certainly had this distinction in mind when he contended, “Why do you [Moses] elevate yourself above the people?”<br/><br/>However, there is one important aspect of the High Priest’s function that Korach overlooked: Just because Aaron was not permitted to leave the sanctuary and associate with the people did not mean that he was uninvolved in their lives. As a matter of fact, we read an inspiring account of Aaron’s service as he provides a remedy for the accusers who are dying as a result of their confrontational service:</p><p><em>Aaron took it, as Moses had ordered, and ran to the midst of the community, where the plague had begun among the people. He put on the incense and made atonement for the people; he stood between the dead and the living until the plague was checked </em>(Num. 16:47-48).”</p><p>Contrary to Korach’s assessment, Aaron and every subsequent High Priest carried a unique burden in how they functioned on behalf of the people. As intercessors and mediators before God on the people’s behalf, they figuratively and quite literally stood between the living and the dead. Part of the responsibility of Kohen Gadol was to draw the people up to his own level of holiness by inspiring them, sanctifying them, and elevating them through the example of his personal conduct. However, Korach did not perceive this responsibility in correspondence to the unlimited potential of the nation. He only saw the distinction and the separation between priest and nation.<br/><br/>When studied in this light, it is easy to see the inconsistency in Korach’s claim. Part of his argument was true, “all Israel is holy,” as Scripture states concerning her: “<em>but you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation</em> (Ex. 19:6).” However, Korach’s failure came as a result of his inability to see those distinct functions as a single entity, edifying each other and working together to sanctify God’s name in the world. Along those lines, the apostle Peter reminds us that despite our diversity and distinct callings, we are “<em>being built into a spiritual house to be priests set apart for God to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to him through Yeshua the Messiah</em> (1 Peter 2:5 CJB).”</p><p>Although part of Korach’s mistake was in assuming that the commoners had as much right and honor as the High Priest, the division he brought into the community had the effect of strengthening the office of the High Priest. In the end, we read about the budding of Aaron’s staff and the 24 priestly gifts that follow in chapters 17 and 18. As previously mentioned, these divine demonstrations produced a sign in Israel of Messianic proportions. Furthermore, its results and the midrashic and prophetic notion that Aaron’s rod should serve not only as affirmation of his priesthood, but also as the scepter of Israel’s monarchy, aligns well with the picture the Book of Hebrews paints about Yeshua as a messianic figure who ultimately unites Israel’s most sacred offices, just as Moses functioned for a time as Israel’s de facto king, prophet, and high priest (see Deut. 18:18).<br/><br/>Herein lies the connection between the first and last verses of our Torah portion. Although Korach represents division and the Torah represents ideals that strive for unity and mutual love, the union that Torah brings comes not in spite of, but through, the medium of division. Just as we see at Creation - the division of waters and the separation of light and darkness - these things precipitate the goodness and blessing that God showers on the earth. In the same way, Israel’s most sacred offices must come with distinction in order to find solidarity and fullness with the coming of the Messiah at the final redemption. The same can be said of Korach. His division was a precondition to strengthening the priestly covenant and securing its validation. Thus, the name of Korach, for better or for worse, is remembered in Scripture.</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

This day, Holocaust Remembrance Day, observed on the 27th of Nisan (May 6th this year), is not merely a date on the calendar; it is a profound call to remember, to learn, and to act. It was chosen with intention, symbolizing not just the immeasurable loss of the six million Jews who perished but also the indomitable spirit of resistance, exemplified by the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.At the core of Israel's commitment to never forget, is Yad Vashem, the beacon on the Mount of Remembrance. More than a memorial, it is a promise to the millions who died without a name, without a trace. Yad Vashem stands as a testament to humanity's capacity for both unspeakable evil and incredible heroism. It honors the victims, the survivors, and the righteous among the nations, like the brave soul who, risking their own life, saved Leah and her family with forged identities and a hidden refuge.Today, as shadows of hate and antisemitism stretch across the globe anew, the echoes of the past urge us to stand vigilant against indifference and inaction. The story of Leah, a survivor whose life was forever altered in the crucible of the Holocaust, challenges us to confront these shadows with the light of empathy and support.Born into the turmoil of war-torn Romania, Leah's childhood was stolen from her in the blink of an eye. Her father was taken, and her family was forced into hiding, moving from their home to a stable, and then to the precarious sanctuary of a neighbor's basement. This neighbor, later honored as Righteous Among the Nations, was their guardian angel, providing false identities and a means of escape to a remote village.The war's end did not return Leah's stolen childhood or erase the scars etched into her soul. Her family's Aliyah brought them to Tel Aviv, but peace remained elusive. Leah's adult years were marred by the shadows of her past: years of crying, battles with major depression, and the recognition of her mental disability due to the traumas she endured. Widowhood and health challenges, including a recent stroke and the mystery of her recurrent falls, compounded her struggles.Yet, Leah's story is also one of incredible resilience and the power of community support. A dedicated social worker, a compassionate volunteer, and the material assistance provided by Vision for Israel have been lifelines, offering her not just physical aid but the invaluable gift of human connection.As Yom HaShoah approaches, we invite you to honor the memory of the six million Jews and to stand with survivors like Leah.

Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, is a time of renewal, hope, and community. It is a time when families gather together to celebrate, share meals, and give thanks for the blessings they have received.But for many families in Israel, this season brings more anxiety than joy. Because of ongoing terror attacks and the financial strain of war, countless families are facing overwhelming hardships. They struggle to provide even the basics for their loved ones, let alone celebrate the holidays with dignity.This year, Vision for Israel is committed to helping 1,500 of these families by providing magnetic gift cards that will allow them to purchase food and essentials for the High Holidays. On average, each family will receive $80. Our goal is to raise 460,000 NIS (about $123,500) to support this critical initiative. The families you help are not just numbers; they are real people with real stories, like Orit.Eighteen years ago, we met Orit when her twin boys were born. At that time, we were able to assist her with baby supplies, and since then, we have maintained a special bond. Orit has given back to us as well, helping with bureaucratic challenges in her role at a government office. Sadly, two years ago, tragedy struck when her husband was injured and had to quit his job, leaving Orit to shoulder all the financial burdens alone. Now, as her sons prepare to join the army, they face new challenges, and we were honored to provide them with supplies at our Millennium Center. The joy and gratitude they expressed were beyond words.Orit's story is just one of many. There are countless families in Israel facing similar hardships—families who have lost loved ones, homes, and livelihoods. They are suffering from anxiety, PTSD, and financial distress. Yet, we have the opportunity to make a difference.As we prepare to welcome the new Jewish year, we are reminded of the importance of caring for those in need.

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nRecently, we partnered with a very special organization in south Tel-Aviv that cares for the homeless. Every day, about 50 –100 people arrive and receive food to eat, a kind word, and an open ear—and if necessary—help for rehabilitation from drugs and alcohol. On the upper level, those who struggle with drug addiction have a designated safe space to detox for 3 days. Long term rehabilitation is offered to them as well, at a different location.\n\nWe had recently begun supporting the soup kitchen, so Batya and Barry went in for a visit. They were deeply impressed with the work being done, and the care given to the homeless of Tel Aviv. “They are doing great work, really. The hungry received cereal with milk, a hot meal, hot and cold drinks, and something sweet. We saw several dozen people who came to eat—they were in such rough shape. And because of the Coronavirus, they couldn’t go inside and the food was served to them outside.” Sadly, the neighbors have protested the food distribution so close to their homes. One of the neighbors even poured water from above to drive away the hungry food recipients, while other neighbors called the police.

Since yesterday, during a Passover week that has only just begun, 34 rockets have been launched against Israel from Lebanon alone. Another 44 rockets have been fired at the southern region from the Gaza Strip. This alarming situation hasn't been seen since 2006, which sparked a war in the north of Israel.The northern region of Israel is filled with tourists visiting and camping, now rushing back to their residences further south due to this imminent danger. As a result, countless families are left exposed and vulnerable, unable to find safety during these terrifying moments.Vision for Israel has taken swift action to provide mobile bomb shelters in the northern region of Israel. To date, we have successfully installed 102 shelters, with plans to deliver 30 more in the near future. Just last week, we approved 15 bomb shelter sites in the north and another 15 in the south. We are awaiting the manufacturer to deliver and install them.It is worth mentioning that nearly every town or city in the south, where we have placed bomb shelters, has been targeted by these recent rocket attacks. Through your support, we have saved lives and given hope to those in need.The Israeli defense and security cabinet is meeting for the first time since February to address the situation. We have spoken with the mayor of one of the towns and the head of security in the region near the Lebanese border. They both shared their assessment of the situation and expressed their gratitude for our efforts at Vision for Israel.With the Iron Dome System intercepting many rockets, still, two persons were injured by shrapnel, and others were treated for shock, but thankfully, no one was killed. We must continue to stand with Israel and provide protection during these trying times.Your generosity can make all the difference in the lives of those who face constant danger. With each mobile shelter costing $12,000, every dollar counts. We implore you to stand with us and help protect innocent lives from the ongoing threat of rocket attacks.Click HERE and select “Medical & Disaster Relief” to donate and make a difference.As we enter this season of reflection and renewal, let us stand united in our efforts to bring comfort and security to those in need.May we have a peaceful and quiet Pesach.Chag Sameach,Barry Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Our land has become a battleground, and our people are the casualties. The sirens have become the background music to our lives, and the feeling of safety has become a distant memory. In times like these, it's important to remember our roots and the promises made that led to the formation of this homeland.Over a century ago, the Balfour Declaration on November 2nd, 1917, paved the way for the realization of a national home for the Jewish people in then-called Palestine. It was a defining moment that promised a sanctuary for us, a place where we could live, work, and raise our families in peace.The climate that led to the Balfour Declaration was highly complex. Under Prime Minister David Lloyd George, the British government became increasingly amenable to the idea of a Jewish homeland. Various factors influenced this stance, ranging from political expedience to a genuine moral obligation felt towards the Jewish cause. The document was a political and diplomatic milestone that laid the foundation for the modern state of Israel. Yet, the recent war that erupted on October 7th has shattered that sense of security and disrupted the lives of so many in our community.Let us share with you the heartbreaking story of Sivan Cohen, one of the thousands of stories that are ripping the heart of our nation at this time.

On that fateful day, they were enjoying a party at the kibbutz, a brief respite from the stressors of daily life.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIsrael entered into this new year of 2024 continuing to fight this long battle of war against Hamas with constant attacks from Hezbollah in the north. In the midst of all of this, now is the time to dig our roots down deep into the Lord, so we can continue to bear fruit for the Lord, stand firm through this war, and not give way to fear.\n\nBeginning on the night of January 24th, Israel will celebrate Tu BiShvat, also called Rosh HaShanah La'Ilanot, which means the ‘New Year of the Trees'. Israelis commemorate this day by focusing on planting trees. In the late 1800s, Jewish pioneers who immigrated to Israel started to plant and build the land. Later in the early 1900s, the Halutzim (pioneers) began planting Eucalyptus trees in the Hula Valley to help stop Malaria. Today, there are tree-planting events every Tu BiShvat, where over a million Israelis participate in planting new trees in the land of Israel.\n\nThe barren land of 2000 years is now a land of planted fruitful trees and flowers. Walking in the marketplaces and grocery stores, you will see lots of fresh and dried fruit with all kinds of natural nuts.\n\nIn the diaspora, they couldn't buy fresh fruits in this season so they celebrated Tu Bishvat by eating dried fruits. This became the symbol of the holiday now even in Israel.\n\nThroughout the Scriptures, man is considered as a tree planted by streams of water that bears fruit. If in the Scriptures we are likened to a healthy tree, what fruit do we give? This means that we as humans have the choice to bear fruit. The role of a tree is to provide fruit and bring life. Therefore, if we are to be like a tree, then we are called to bear fruit in the spirit that brings life represented to us in the scriptures: The symbol of a good tree who is bearing good and healthy fruits is a symbol for us to be in good spiritual place in order to bear good spiritual fruits.\n\n“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against these things there is no law.” - Galatians 5:22-23\n\nTrees do not eat the fruits they produce, but instead, they produce fruit and vegetables to give to humans and to animals for their daily and physical existence. The seeds of the fruits are also reproduced and fertilized, which multiply and produce even more fruit. In fact, the root of the word fruit in Hebrew (P'ri) is also the word for being fruitful: \"Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth...\" (Gen. 1:28a).\n\n“But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop.”(Luke 8:15)\n\nLike trees, humans have also been blessed to give of themselves to others and cause constant reproduction.\n\n“For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants. They will spring up like grass in a meadow, like poplar trees by flowing streams.” (Isaiah 44:3-4)\n\nDuring this time at Vision for Israel, we are helping others recognize their abilities to bear fruit and equipping them with the tools they need to recover through our various therapeutic workshops. As we provide tools for their recovery, they are able to continue to bear fruit and be like a tree planted by streams of water. We are thankful for friends like you, who give of your fruits, so we are able to produce even more fruits to continue blessing those around us!\n\n“He shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper.” — Psalms 1:3\n\nNow more than ever, God is inviting us to partner with him in planting His seeds of love into the hearts of His people. We pray that for such a time as this, God will plant you in the rivers of His living water to be like a mighty oak tree of His righteousness on display for HIS splendor!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nAs we reflect on the first quarter of 2025, we are humbled and grateful for the extraordinary impact your partnership has made possible. In a time of ongoing uncertainty and recovery, your support has brought tangible hope and healing to countless individuals across Israel. From financial aid for families affected by war to vital medical supplies and trauma care for survivors, each act of generosity has echoed God’s faithfulness. This report offers a glimpse into what we’ve accomplished together so far this year — thanks to your compassion, prayers, and steadfast commitment.\n\nIn January, Vision for Israel placed 23 bomb shelters in northern Israeli towns near the Lebanese border. These shelters were installed in public and central locations such as synagogues, schools, playgrounds, and elderly clubs, providing essential protection during ongoing attacks. Since the project began, 422 shelters have been placed. Many residents, displaced for over a year, are beginning to return to their homes. These shelters offer a measure of safety and hope. We are deeply grateful to our donors whose generous support makes this life-saving work possible.\n\nWe donated 64 paramedic kits and 2 advanced doctor kits to emergency teams in Ma’aleh Yosef and Merom HaGalil, northern Israeli regions under threat. These frontline responders protect evacuated towns from both attacks and looting. Council representatives expressed heartfelt thanks for the equipment, calling it “critical” for readiness and safety. The security situation remains volatile, and our support empowers these brave volunteers to act swiftly in emergencies. Your donations truly equip these communities for life-saving response.\n\nTo celebrate Tu B’Shvat, Vision for Israel hosted 60 Holocaust survivors from Tel Aviv and Modi’in at the Millennium Center for a joyful morning of music and connection. A musical duo performed with violins, harmonicas, and more — sparking dancing and smiles. VFI arranged transportation and served a healthy breakfast with a dessert treat. Survivors expressed deep gratitude, many attending for the first time. One guest shared, “I’m thrilled that we’re remembered with so much respect.” Thank you for making events like these possible, where dignity and joy are restored.\n\nWe donated essential gear to a reserve battalion stationed in Gaza, made up mostly of Givati veterans. Items included a solar power station, heaters, ski masks, and more. A soldier, exempt from duty but who volunteered anyway, collected the donation. He described the immense psychological toll of the war, with many soldiers suffering from PTSD. “This donation is our most significant fuel,” he said. Despite a drop in public support as the war drags on, your faithfulness helps sustain and uplift our soldiers in the hardest places.\n\nBefore Passover, we distributed aid to 1,200 families across central and southern Israel. Rising living costs continue to burden vulnerable households, and this year we increased the gift card amounts to better meet their needs. Our team personally met many families and heard their stories—stories of hardship, but also of faith and perseverance. With your support, these families will be able to celebrate the holiday with dignity and joy. Thank you for standing with us and ensuring no table is left empty this Passover.\n\nOver 250 children and their families, all victims of terror, joined our joyful Purim event at the Millennium Center. Children arrived in costumes and enjoyed inflatables, games, crafts, a circus show, and festive music. A delicious lunch was served, along with popcorn, cotton candy, and drinks. Many parents thanked us, sharing how much this day meant during a time of deep anxiety and trauma. Together with the Victims of Hostilities Organization, we created a space of joy and relief. Your support makes this kind of healing possible.\n\nOn Good Deeds Day (March 18), we welcomed 60 seniors from Modi’in to the Millennium Center for a heartwarming cultural event. Guests enjoyed music, dancing, and comedy, lifting spirits and bringing laughter to many faces. A breakfast of sandwiches and vegetables was served, and city officials joined to show appreciation for VFI’s ongoing support of the city’s elderly. These events give seniors not only nourishment but joy and human connection. Your partnership makes this possible—thank you for blessing their lives in such meaningful ways.\n\nBarry participated in the dedication of our newest ambulance donated to Magen David Adom in Tiberius—a fully equipped mobile intensive care unit (MICU). This marks the 13th ambulance Vision for Israel has donated. MICUs offer advanced care even before reaching the hospital, greatly increasing survival rates. In times of war and peace alike, this ambulance will serve the people of Israel with critical, life-saving care. Thank you for helping us respond to urgent medical needs and strengthen Israel’s emergency readiness.\n\nAn appreciation event was held in Kfar Saba for about 100 reserve wives from a southern battalion that has completed over 300 days of front-line duty. While their husbands serve, these women face the challenges of managing home and family alone, often with little recognition. Awareness of their sacrifices is growing, and Vision for Israel is helping support them. The evening featured a stand-up show, a rich dairy meal donated by VFI, and small gifts to lift their spirits. Barry and Batya attended the event, honoring the strength and resilience of these dedicated women.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

An entire nation cries out for salvation and comfort. Yet, amidst the hardships, there have been victories in battle, a crushing defeat of the enemy, and glimmers of hope. Still, many remain wounded, both physically and mentally, bearing the scars of war. Poverty continues to rise, with a significant growth in the population falling below the poverty line.\n\nDespite it all, we have witnessed achievements in various fields. It is clear that life remains a mix of triumphs and trials, and the cycle continues.As we look to the future, we pray for a coming year filled with love, kindness, and generosity of heart. Let it be a year where giving and compassion flourish, where the needs of the many are met by the care and generosity of others.This year, we celebrated the 30th anniversary of Vision for Israel. These have been 30 amazing years of tireless work and dedication. Even in the face of immense challenges, we have seen that when the struggles are greater, the victories shine even brighter.We firmly believe that the ultimate cure for the obstacles and challenges in life is love—a love that inspires generosity of heart, joy in all circumstances, and hope for the days ahead.\n\nWe celebrated our 30th anniversary with friends and partners in the UK and US. Thank you to everyone who joined us!\n\nEvery year Vision for Israel distributes gift cards for the high holidays to enable families in need to celebrate the holiday with joy, dignity, and a full table. Even before the war began, many families in Israel were in tough financial situations. And now, over a year of war, thousands of families have been evacuated from their homes, lost loved ones, and have experienced trauma from the war leaving many more in need. This September VFI provided about 1,300 gift cards to victims of hostilities, Holocaust survivors, soldiers from difficult backgrounds, and welfare families. Our team traveled to many cities throughout Israel to personally deliver these gifts, meet the families, and be a comfort to them.With grateful hearts, these families thanked us and openly shared about their difficult situations. As we listened to each story, we saw deeper into the many layers of pain and difficulty that the people of Israel are going through right now. Thank you for practically helping these families in Israel continue to celebrate God’s goodness, even during the war.\n\nWith the ongoing war, many women who are already in distress, are afraid they will not be able to provide for their children properly, and they seek abortion. VFI donated supplies to an organization in Kfar Saba that cares for women in distress. We were able to help single moms, women with families in need, women in prostitution and drugs, and women who are unexpectedly pregnant. Your donations to VFI have helped provide essential needs for these women and their babies like diapers, bottles, and clothes. The organization thanked us for our priceless cooperation, and we give thanks to God and you for supporting life!\n\nNow more than ever, during the war, Israel needs more ambulances to help save as many lives as possible. Thanks to our generous donors, two more ambulances were donated to MDA this quarter! One ambulance is a mobile intensive care unit (MICU) and the other is a regular service ambulance. Both will provide medical response in central Israel. Barry and Batya attended the dedication event and were honored by the MDA staff and volunteers. We thank our generous donors who have made it possible to present such a large-scale donation that will surely save many lives.\n\nVFI held a free clothing day (bazaar-style) for 250 children and their parents in Rishon LeTzion. We brought a large amount of almost new and second-hand clothes to families who could not afford new clothes. Each family picked out the clothes they wanted and left with several bags of clothes that could be used by the children and parents while maintaining their dignity and well-being.For many, this was the first opportunity to receive quality clothing after a long period in which they had to make do with what they had. This endeavor improved the situation of many families, and their gratefulness was heartwarming!\n\nAs the war with Lebanon has intensified, we have accelerated the placement of bomb shelters in communities near the northern border. Since September, we have placed 59 bomb shelters in northern Israel, bringing the total number to 399. The shelters were placed in public areas, near schools, bus stops, sports stadiums, and parks to help Israelis continue to live their lives during this intense time of war. Thank you for your generous donations that help provide a safe place for Israelis to run to as rockets are launched daily.\n\nEven though the high holidays are over, our help continues as we stand by families in need throughout the year. We provide gift cards to families and increase the amount on the gift cards for larger families of 8 members or more. As our team meets with these families, we get the opportunity to hear their stories. Some are struggling with health problems, which prevent them from working and providing for their families. Some have children with special needs, which require high costs for the treatments they need. Others are just struggling with the high costs of living in Israel. And many are reserve soldiers that had to leave their families and jobs, to fight for the protection of the nation of Israel.Thank you faithful donors for generously giving to the Family Aid fund! Your donations are making a tangible impact throughout the nation of Israel.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nNo matter what we go through in life, we all need the faithful love of God that will never give up on us. Yossi’s story is one where we can see the love of God pursuing his heart through the ups and downs of his life.Yossi, 42, lives in Sderot with his mother and brother. At a young age, Yossi became friends with a group of people who negatively influenced him into substance abuse. From that point on, Yossi began to drink and use drugs. Over years of excessive consumption of alcohol, Yossi began to experience significant physical and mental effects. It got so bad that he almost lost his liver. As a result of the damage to the liver, he received 100% disability from National Insurance. To this day, Yossi lives off of this disability.Yossi received help at a rehab center for several years to help him with his addiction. He ended up recovering so well that he began to help others overcome their addictions. For 5 consecutive and dedicated years, he worked as an instructor in rehab helping many teenagers and adults with their rehabilitation. He was highly esteemed by his team and was able to advance to the position of instructor coordinator.In 2021, Yossi lost his father in a fire that broke out in his house while he was sleeping. He also lost a mentor who had accompanied him for years through his journey of recovery. And on top of that, he separated from his partner. With all of these overwhelming and heartbreaking circumstances, Yossi fell hard back into the world of drugs and alcohol.He moved in with his mother in Sderot and was broken, depressed, hopeless, and without any desire to live. Many made the effort to help him go back to rehab and recovery, but Yossi was so overwhelmed with sorrow, shame, and guilt that he couldn’t get out of his addictions. He hit rock bottom when he became a beggar at the central bus station in Tel Aviv. Even though Yossi had given up, his friends, mentors, and God never gave up on him. Many of his friends, who were former addicts, searched for him on the streets of Tel Aviv to encourage him and talk with him. But the final turning point was when Yossi got run over on the roads of Tel Aviv. He suffered serious injuries and almost lost his legs, but God spared his life and his legs. As soon as Yossi’s social worker and friends heard about his accident, they visited him at the hospital. They continued to faithfully visit him day after day during his long recovery at the hospital. When he was finally discharged from the hospital, he agreed to go directly to rehab. He went through rehab successfully and then moved to a therapeutic community for a year. From there he continued to a therapeutic hostel, where he began to thrive and help many others in their recovery process as well. When he finished the program and felt strong, he returned home.Shortly after returning home, the horrific events of October 7th happened. At the time of the incident, Yossi was at his mother’s house, and his sister (divorced) with 6 children, was at her house which was close to the police station in Sderot. This police station was overrun by Hamas terrorists who ruthlessly killed 35 Israeli officers and civilians. When Yossi realized there was danger outside, he called his sister to try and rescue her and the kids. Heroically, Yossi drove towards his sister's house and bravely managed to rescue all of them by piling them into his car. As they drove towards his mother's house, bullets were flying all around them, however, they managed to arrive safely.In the following days, they were relocated with thousands of other Israelis. For several months they were displaced from their homes, but Yossi and his mother have finally returned to her house. Today, Yossi still lives with his mother, but he realizes more and more that he needs his own space and privacy. Yossi had purchased an apartment during his \"good\" years but did not move into it because of the challenging situations he went through. He would like to return to his own apartment but needs financial assistance to continue to pay his mortgage and for the necessary appliances for his apartment.Thankfully today, Yossi has rehabilitated his life and is still connected to his mentors and treatments, who help him maintain his recovery. He also plans to return to instructing and helping others recover from their addictions.

They even switched it up and entertained everyone as they sang in five different languages -- Greek, English, Hebrew, Spanish, and Yiddish.As all enjoyed the musical melodies with smiles spread wide across their faces, they snacked on savory pastries, and dips, and enjoyed hot and cold drinks. Barry and Batya were privileged to meet the Holocaust survivors face to face and greet them; they also had the opportunity to share with the group a little bit about themselves and how Vision for Israel will continue to support the thousands of Holocaust survivors still living in Israel today.It's always important for us to connect with the people we are serving, as oftentimes, they find themselves on the sidelines of society -- invisible and ignored. Shaking their hands and looking into their eyes as they greet us are moments that will stay with them (and us) long after they leave.The group was then seated around tables for a delicious and filling lunch of stuffed vegetables, meat skewers, chicken and salmon, green salad, green beans, beet carpaccio, and individual desserts.After that, one of the Holocaust survivors came up to sing, which encouraged the rest of the group to join in the singing as well. They even got up to dance as the room filled with laughter and joy!It is no surprise that everyone enjoyed the musical morning as much as they did, as part of the group are members of the Desert Sounds ensemble, a famous and popular musical group that performs around Israel.Later, we discovered through the coordinator of the south branch that this was the first event the survivors attended since the Covid pandemic started and that they were very excited and happy to be there.Knowing we provided them with their first outing after a long and challenging period warmed our hearts to the core. We will always make it a priority to bless the remaining Holocaust survivors in Israel and remind them, through events such as this, just how grateful we are for their bravery and courage.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThere is a time and a season for everything. There is a time to be silent and a time to speak. In Israel on Yom HaShoah or Holocaust Remembrance Day, the entire nation takes two minutes to be silent. At 10 am, a siren rings throughout every city in Israel for two minutes. Israelis stop and stand in silence, and even pull over on the side of the road, to silently honor their fellow Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust and those who survived the horrors. If you have ever been in Israel during this time, it is truly a powerful moment of silence. This year, Holocaust Remembrance Day starts on April 23rd at sundown and ends on April 24th at sundown. Israel takes this day seriously and considers it a day of sorrow as they remember the 6 million Jews who endured such cruel torture and death during the Holocaust. Israel not only commemorates this day with a moment of silence but also with ceremonies of leaders speaking about the truths of the Holocaust.The official national ceremony is held in Jerusalem at Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance center. Every year they choose 6 Holocaust Survivors to hold a torch to represent the memory of the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. There are also many ceremonies honoring the Holocaust Survivors still alive today. An estimated 123,000 Holocaust Survivors are living in Israel today. This year marks 80 years since the Nazi regime was defeated in April 1945. We mourn the devastation of the Holocaust, but we also rejoice that God established Israel as an independent Jewish state in 1948, three years after the Holocaust ended. This year Israel will celebrate its 77th Independence Day on April 30th. Even in all of this sorrow, let us remember that God is faithful to destroy Israel’s enemies and help the Jewish people possess the land of Israel!\n\n“For the wicked will be destroyed, but those who trust in the Lord will possess the land.” – Psalm 37:9\n\nThis year, just like last year, Israel is in a place of mourning and heartache daily due to the Iron Swords War that continues, with no end in sight. And, even still, the nation takes time to honor those that suffered during the Holocaust. All the more, it is vital for us to remember how these wicked ideologies rapidly escalated to mass murders. And we pray this will never happen again!It is important to take time to be silent, to remember, and to pray, however, we cannot just remain silent. We need courage from the Lord to speak against antisemitism and speak up for the Jewish people.\n\n“Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute.” – Proverbs 31:8\n\nNow more than ever, it is important to remember what happened during the Holocaust. But, what exactly are we remembering? We are mourning the innocent lives of millions of Jews and many others who were brutally and systematically murdered. We remember the unbelievable evil and hatred towards the Jewish people that we still see in the world today. We also remember the ones who risked their lives to save hundreds or even just one precious life. We remember the ones that bravely stood up against the regime, and fought for the innocent. And we pray that God will give us the courage to stand up for righteousness in the face of evil, especially during this current war Israel is in.\n\nThe hatred of Jews is not a new thing. We see it throughout the scriptures in the Bible, especially through Pharaoh in the Book of Exodus and Haman’s plot to destroy the Jews in the Book of Esther. However, God can give us the courage to stand up against the enemies of the Jewish people, just like He did for the people of Israel in Egypt, and Esther and Mordecai.Israel has been battling in this current war for about a year and a half, and we have seen the hatred towards the Jewish people not only on Israel’s borders but all around the world. Since the war began, we have seen antisemitism increase around the world, especially in the United States. Antisemitic protests flooded college campuses around the USA, traveling Israelis encountered terror attacks and threats around the world, and much more. From October 7th, 2023 to October 2024, there were over 10,000 antisemitic incidents in the United States. This is the largest number of antisemitic incidents within one year. Another aspect of antisemitism is the very act of trying to deny or lessen the reality of the atrocities during the Holocaust. Today, many are trying to limit the amount of education about the Holocaust in schools by enforcing laws and fines. Political leaders are twisting the truth and changing what is communicated about the Holocaust at museums and exhibitions. And many political leaders are rejecting the importance of remembering what happened in the Holocaust. The very act of misrepresenting historical facts about the Holocaust and hindering communication and education about it is antisemitic. So, what can we do to help fight against antisemitism?\n\nOur first response is to pray. Pray for the protection of the Jewish people around the world and the nation of Israel. Another way to take a stand against antisemitism is to speak the truth about what happened during the Holocaust. The systematic murder of 6 million Jews, which was about 1/3 of the Jewish population at the time, is incomprehensible. And yet, we need to comprehend that the Holocaust really did happen. Another way to fight antisemitism is to ask God for the courage to speak up when we see and hear hatred against the Jewish people. God may have placed you in a job, position, or place to be able to speak His truth, bring about change, and help protect his people. Another practical way to fight antisemitism is to stand with the Jewish people in their suffering. Let us mourn for the ones we lost, but also pray for those who have endured the Holocaust and are still alive today. If you have the opportunity, you should sit down with a Holocaust Survivor and serve them in some way. And maybe you will even hear some of their heart-wrenching stories and can comprehend just a small part of what they suffered. Many of these resilient Holocaust Survivors still have nightmares of the horrors they and their loved ones suffered through.Let us express our love and support to the remaining Holocaust Survivors still with us today. VFI has been able to support Holocaust Survivors for many years hosting many special events for them to connect with other survivors, and just to bless them!

In this last year and a half, about 80,000 Israelis left Israel, and only 30,000 returned and another 30,000 were new immigrants. We can see there is a deep fear in the people for many reasons, but one could also be the trauma their ancestors suffered during the Holocaust. Today, the Jewish people are suffering from trauma along with economic difficulties due to the war. There are still rockets and missiles being fired at Israel on a daily/weekly basis from Gaza, Hezbollah, Houthis, and Iran.

There is a time to be silent and a time to speak. In Israel on Yom HaShoah or Holocaust Remembrance Day, the entire nation takes two minutes to be silent. At 10 am, a siren rings throughout every city in Israel for two minutes. Israelis stop and stand in silence, and even pull over on the side of the road, to silently honor their fellow Jews who were murdered during the Holocaust and those who survived the horrors. If you have ever been in Israel during this time, it is truly a powerful moment of silence. <br/><br/>This year, Holocaust Remembrance Day starts on April 23rd at sundown and ends on April 24th at sundown. Israel takes this day seriously and considers it a day of sorrow as they remember the 6 million Jews who endured such cruel torture and death during the Holocaust. Israel not only commemorates this day with a moment of silence but also with ceremonies of leaders speaking about the truths of the Holocaust.<br/><br/>The official national ceremony is held in Jerusalem at Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance center. Every year they choose 6 Holocaust Survivors to hold a torch to represent the memory of the 6 million Jews who were murdered in the Holocaust. There are also many ceremonies honoring the Holocaust Survivors still alive today. An estimated 123,000 Holocaust Survivors are living in Israel today. <br/><br/>This year marks 80 years since the Nazi regime was defeated in April 1945. We mourn the devastation of the Holocaust, but we also rejoice that God established Israel as an independent Jewish state in 1948, three years after the Holocaust ended. This year Israel will celebrate its 77th Independence Day on April 30th. Even in all of this sorrow, let us remember that God is faithful to destroy Israel’s enemies and help the Jewish people possess the land of Israel!</p><p><em>“For the wicked will be destroyed, but those who trust in the Lord will possess the land.” – Psalm 37:9</em></p><p>This year, just like last year, Israel is in a place of mourning and heartache daily due to the Iron Swords War that continues, with no end in sight.

Shavu'ot, known as Pentecost in the Christian tradition, marks the giving of the Torah to the nation of Israel at Mount Sinai and the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus.We are also reminded of the importance of investing in the future of our nation. Just as Shavu'ot is a time to celebrate the first fruits, we recognize the immense potential within our young children, who are like the first fruits themselves.In the essence of the holiday, we invite you to participate in a wonderful opportunity to support Israeli families in need by helping us provide backpacks filled with school supplies for 2,000 children.\n\nAt Vision for Israel, we have been providing backpacks filled with essential school supplies to students from underprivileged families for over 20 years. Our Pack to School project has already impacted the lives of nearly 300,000 children, giving them the tools they need to succeed in their education and make Israel a better place in the future.\n\nShavu'ot has strong agricultural roots as a harvest festival. The Jews, when settled in the Promised Land, celebrated the Lord's provision for His people during Shavu'ot. They presented the first fruits of their spring crops to the Lord as a freewill offering, in accordance with Deuteronomy 16:10 and Numbers 28:26.\n\n\"On the Day of Firstfruits, when you offer to Adonai a new grain offering during the Feast of Weeks, you are to have a sacred assembly. You are to do no laborious work.\"\n\nThis year, our goal is to provide 2,000 children with backpacks, and we need your help to make this possible.

It is beautiful to see the people so touched by God’s love through a practical need that we were able to meet. Thank you for the incredible impact you are making on the people here in the Land of Israel. Now, let’s take a closer look at how God provided through you and VFI to impact these precious people.\n\nWhile the children of Israel were on summer vacation, the expenses for families were increasing significantly. For distressed families, this is a particularly difficult time. Our team set out to distribute aid to hundreds of families around the country. Each family received a magnetic gift card, hygiene products, food, and a basket of fresh vegetables. The recipients were very happy and expressed their gratitude and appreciation to VFI.One of the recipients, a father of a family who immigrated from the former USSR, shared that his family was in need of hygiene products. They had to give them up because of their severe economic hardship. When he saw that the donation included hygiene items, he exclaimed: \"I'm shocked! Wow, this is unbelievable! Everything is from God! Thank you very much!\" We were very touched by his story and how God provided exactly what he and his family needed.\n\nThe school year began in September and we are happy to know that the sweet children from low-income families arrived at school with high-quality school bags, just like all the other children. During July and August, the VFI team distributed school bags through our Pack to School project to about 1,000 children from low-income families throughout Israel, including Rishon Lezion, Jerusalem, Sderot, Ashdod, Petach Tikva, Lod, Rosh Ha'Ayin, Tel Aviv, Modi'in, and Netivot. Some of these children are at risk, refugee children, children with special needs, or new immigrants. At some of the distribution points, we held fun activities for the children. On the first day of school, our hearts were filled with comfort as we remembered their sweet smiles and the words of thanks we received from these precious children. Rise and succeed, dear children!\n\nAs part of our collaboration with the Yad b'Yad organization, which cares for children at risk, Vision for Israel invited dozens of children at risk in preschool through 2nd grade for a day of pampering. The children arrived in transportation sponsored by VFI from all over the country to the Millennium Center. Upon their arrival, the children received a light breakfast. The day's activities included an interactive performance by the Sippur Theater, pizza for lunch, and a gift of a backpack with stationery or a kindergarten bag. These dear children, who come from distressed families, impacted us with their smiles, words of thanks, and the light in their eyes.\n\nThe VFI staff distributed 69 school bags to first graders who are asylum-seekers children in Tel Aviv. These families are treated by the municipal welfare unit Mesila, which provides them with assistance and psycho-social treatment. We met families with health problems, parents in long-term hospitalization, children with special needs, single-parent families, and more. Many live in abject poverty, without entitlement to allowances in extreme situations, with almost no rights or social services. We received a very moving thank you letter from Mesila, saying: \"I would like to point out the kindness, professionalism, and great kindness on the part of the Vision Israel team [...] They welcomed the parents and children who came to receive the school bags and did not give them even a single moment a sense of need [ ...] A huge thank you for helping many of the community's children start the year with a new backpack and with a smile.\"\n\nWith the high holidays upon us, there is an atmosphere of leaving our troubles behind and looking ahead with hope towards the new year. Every year, Vision for Israel takes care of families who cannot put a holiday meal on the table or celebrate the holidays with dignity.The VFI team arrived in various cities throughout Israel to distribute gift cards to about 1,500 families and individuals to help them buy groceries for the holiday meals, clothes, and anything else they might need.

It is beautiful to see the people so touched by God’s love through a practical need that we were able to meet. Thank you for the incredible impact you are making on the people here in the Land of Israel. Now, let’s take a closer look at how God provided through you and VFI to impact these precious people.  </p><p>While the children of Israel were on summer vacation, the expenses for families were increasing significantly. For distressed families, this is a particularly difficult time. Our team set out to distribute aid to hundreds of families around the country. Each family received a magnetic gift card, hygiene products, food, and a basket of fresh vegetables. The recipients were very happy and expressed their gratitude and appreciation to VFI.<br/><br/>One of the recipients, a father of a family who immigrated from the former USSR, shared that his family was in need of hygiene products. They had to give them up because of their severe economic hardship. When he saw that the donation included hygiene items, he exclaimed: \"I'm shocked! Wow, this is unbelievable! Everything is from God! Thank you very much!\" We were very touched by his story and how God provided exactly what he and his family needed.</p><p>The school year began in September and we are happy to know that the sweet children from low-income families arrived at school with high-quality school bags, just like all the other children. During July and August, the VFI team distributed school bags through our <em>Pack to School </em>project to about 1,000 children from low-income families throughout Israel, including Rishon Lezion, Jerusalem, Sderot, Ashdod, Petach Tikva, Lod, Rosh Ha'Ayin, Tel Aviv, Modi'in, and Netivot. Some of these children are at risk, refugee children, children with special needs, or new immigrants. <br/><br/>At some of the distribution points, we held fun activities for the children. On the first day of school, our hearts were filled with comfort as we remembered their sweet smiles and the words of thanks we received from these precious children. Rise and succeed, dear children!</p><p>As part of our collaboration with the Yad b'Yad organization, which cares for children at risk, </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>",

Ofer*, a 29-year-old young attorney, was standing with friends outside a café—talking, laughing, maybe dreaming of what the future would hold. He had just started a new job, launched his legal career after graduating with honors, and was finally seeing the fruits of years of hard work.But then came a moment that changed everything.Without warning, a terrorist attacked Ofer from behind, stabbing him in the back of the neck with a long, sharp knife. The blade pierced 4 centimeters deep. It was a miracle that he survived. Just seconds earlier, Ofer had borrowed a friend’s visor hat and casually turned it backwards onto his head. That small, seemingly insignificant gesture absorbed enough of the impact to prevent the knife from reaching a main artery—an artery that, had it been severed, would have taken his life instantly.“A second here or a centimeter there,” Ofer later wrote, “and I wouldn’t be alive.”Ofer was rushed to the hospital, bleeding heavily and facing internal injuries. He underwent surgery and spent days in recovery. But when he left the hospital, his journey was far from over. He lost nerve sensation in parts of his head and neck. Chronic pain in his shoulder and arm made even writing an email a struggle. His physical strength—once shaped by regular workouts and athletic training—felt shattered.And mentally? The trauma is deep.He now lives in a state of hyper-alertness. Crowded streets, unfamiliar faces—everyday moments can trigger overwhelming anxiety and fear.He once gave freely of his time and money, volunteering and donating to help others. But now, his own needs have brought him to a place of vulnerability. Medical expenses, especially for trauma therapy, are high. National Insurance has limited support, and psychologists through the public system are overbooked. Ofer had to seek private help—and the cost was more than he could bear.That’s when he reached out to Vision for Israel.Though it was difficult for him to ask, he humbly requested our help. And because of your generosity, we were able to say yes. Ofer is now receiving the specialized trauma therapy he desperately needs. But his road to healing is long, and he cannot walk it alone.Dear friends, Ofer is just one of many who have survived the physical violence of terrorism—only to face an even harder battle for recovery. Right now, he still cannot work. Rent, utilities, treatment—it’s all piling up.Your gift today can help Ofer continue his therapy, cover his basic expenses, and most importantly—hold onto hope.Please give now to support people like Ofer who have suffered unimaginable trauma but are fighting to heal.Let’s stand with Ofer.

As support from the Israeli government dwindles for its people, many families are finding themselves falling on hard times. Without government programs and regulations lowering the prices of housing and basic goods, hundreds of thousands of people will fall even deeper into poverty. We must do what we can to help them.Vision for Israel has always worked hard to provide for the poor, and as we approach the High Holidays, our mission of spreading love and compassion is more important than ever. The renewal of Rosh Hashanah, the somber reflection of Yom Kippur — this holy season is a time in the Jewish calendar when we do \"cheshbon ha'nefesh\" (searching of the soul) or spend time examining the past year. It is a time to look back at what we did right, what we did wrong, and strive to do better as we move forward into a new year. These celebrations are a meaningful way to highlight our moral responsibility toward one another. Here at VFI, we have always felt the weight of responsibility in giving to those who are suffering. We were founded on the principle of caring for the weak and the underprivileged. Our responsibility is to be at every event of the distribution of the financial magnetic cards. Our team is in every distribution and the donation is delivered directly to the head of the family. We do this for us and for you so that the donation goes directly to those in need without any intermediaries.\n\n\"A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.\" — John 13:34\n\nThat’s why we are embracing this special time of year by giving financial gift cards to families in need. We want to ensure that all who suffer from lack of food will have the ability to celebrate these High Holidays with dignity and be satisfied.This holiday season Vision for Israel is thinking of those families and will be donating a total of $125,000 for their welfare. Each family will receive a gift of $125. Your contributions stand to make a lasting impact on those who are struggling right now. Embrace the High Holidays by giving to the poor and hungry.

Though their efforts will surely help, our team is preparing for the months ahead.Vision for Israel believes in being ready for crises and times where we all face more challenges because when a crisis comes it's too late to prepare. We have learned to keep and set aside survival and emergency items for any disaster that may happen.So now we are preparing again for those who are coming and those who will arrive soon. We must be ready and have the resources and supplies to support them when they get here. They will need basic furniture, food, household supplies, hygiene products, clothes, and much more. They need someone they can depend on. As always, our team is up to the challenge.We must also not forget that Vision for Israel is still supporting local families who are experiencing poverty, illness, or hardship.

No matter what happens in Israel, we are committed to being here to support those who need it, just as God has always been here for us.It’s impossible to convey how much we need you, our loyal friends and partners, right now.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIsrael was thrust into the war on October 7, 2023, and now, one year later, Israel is still at war. It has been a hard year for this nation, and yet you have enabled us to serve and come alongside the people of Israel through it all. It has been our joy to pour out God’s love in tangible ways by serving, loving, and providing for the needs of the Jewish people, especially during this last year of war. Let’s take a look at some of the ways VFI has served the people of Israel over these last few months.\n\nNorthern Israel has been susceptible to fires due to the summer heat and daily rockets launched from Lebanon. These rockets have hit houses, forests, pastures, agricultural fields, and thousands of dunams, which have caused fires to spread and destroy so much.With your generous donations, VFI donated life-saving protective equipment to Kibbutz Gonen valued at about NIS 83,000. The gear donated included tactical helmets, a generator, vests, ceramic plates, stretchers, first aid kits, fire extinguishers, hoses, a water cannon, and a fire hydrant. These items helped save and protect many lives.\n\nAs we mark the 30th anniversary of VFI, we are reminded of the profound impact your support has enabled us to achieve. Over the last 3 years, your generous contributions have made it possible to install close to 400 safety shelters across Israel. These shelters have protected and saved many lives.\n\nOn July 22nd, we placed 10 shelters in the north, including 3 in Majdal Shams. Tragically, just days later, a rocket attack killed 12 children there. Amid this heartbreaking news, we are relieved that one of our shelters saved the lives of 9 children!\n\nSince the beginning of the war, Kibbutz Amir, which is near the city of Kiryat Shmona, has been under constant attack from Lebanon. Being so close to the border, the members and the emergency response squad of the kibbutz are forced to defend themselves. VFI donated 107,000 NIS worth of equipment including vests, tactical helmets, tactical gloves, dust goggles, ceramic plates, headlamps, first aid kits, a defibrillator, and a doctor’s first aid kit. We salute the brave emergency squad who is ready to sacrifice their lives for the safety of the residents.\n\nOn June 26th, we hosted 32 Holocaust survivors at the Millennium Center for a special brunch, musical performance, and ambulance dedication. Everyone enjoyed the brunch along with the colorful musical performance. We could see the joy on the survivors’ faces as they danced and sang along to the music.\n\nWe all gathered outside for the dedication of a GMC 4X4 ambulance that is designed to reach tough terrain, which was donated to MDA.\n\nThe municipal policing team in Sderot fought hard on October 7, to defend their people, and want to be better equipped for the future, especially during the war. They expressed their need for another municipal police vehicle, and within a short time, God provided the finances for a new vehicle!\n\nOn July 3rd, we dedicated the municipal police vehicle at a ceremony held with Sderot’s mayor, Alon Davidi. He thanked us for the support over the years, especially since October 7th, and expressed great gratitude and appreciation for the donors and supporters of VFI from all over the world!\n\nFor over 24 years, VFI has been donating schoolbags to children from families facing financial difficulties, and to date, we have reached over 285,000 children. This summer, we distributed hundreds of schoolbags across the country, including in cities such as Rosh Ha'ayin, Rishon LeZion, Ashdod, Jerusalem, Lod, Sderot, Netivot, Ofakim, and more. It was heartwarming to witness the gratitude of the parents, alongside the children joyfully running toward us to receive their new backpacks.\n\nWe remain committed to ensuring that many Israeli children can begin the school year with schoolbags and the necessary stationery, helping them feel equal in the classroom and giving them the tools to succeed in their studies.\n\nDuring one of our distributions, a red alert siren went off, and we had to seek shelter. Another siren followed soon after—a reminder that life continues even in times of war.\n\nVFI hosted a scholarship ceremony at the Millennium Center for 60 students who are victims of hostilities. This year, the scholarship amount awarded to each student was increased. The goal of these scholarships is to encourage students to pursue professional careers, support their rehabilitation, invest in their future, and help them break free from the cycle of trauma. As each student received their scholarship, some shared their chosen profession, a bit about their life story, or spoke of family members affected by acts of violence. It was a deeply moving and special ceremony.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIn March of 1988, there was a terror attack known as the Mothers' Bus Attack. Terrorists infiltrated the Egyptian border and managed to take over a bus that was transporting workers to work.That day, Alon’s* father rode that bus as he did every day. But this time, his usual bus ride took a tragic turn. He was held hostage and was eventually murdered by the terrorists.Alon’s father was his only parent when he died. His mother had died shortly before, after a long battle with cancer.It seems symbolic that his father, who acted as both father and mother to his family, was killed on the Mothers’ Bus.The hostages that did not perish said that Alon’s father was a hero, and sacrificed his life rescuing the women that were on the bus as the driver opened the doors and fled. His father was left alone to deal with the horror, and he acted nobly.Alon’s father was far from being ready to die. He was just 39, towards the end of his doctorate studies in laser welding. Many of his coworkers said that he would be the next CEO of the company.This and many other things didn’t happen. Alon and his brothers didn’t get to see their father advance in his career or see his children and grandchildren grow. Alon and his two brothers were very small at the time, and they lost the only remaining parent they had. They were left with no one and were put into foster care. The difficulties Alon faced after experiencing loss at such a young age, are exactly the same as the orphans included in the 2012 Compensation Law for Animosity Orphans. Yet he has not seen compensation through this law. The government was supposed to help and support the victims' orphans rather than create additional hardships. However, Alon was denied essential assistance from the state. In response, he turned to the court to seek protection under The Compensation Law for Animosity Orphans.The state has failed to pay any sort of compensation to Alon.Since the day of the terror attack, Alon has been living in a state of survival. The pain of losing his parents has only grown over the past 33 years. Losing both parents within six months of each other at such a young age is unbearable.The crises that followed the attack were only made worse by the absence of his parents and lack of support. 8 years ago Alon lost the family he was building to a difficult divorce. The economic hardships that followed affect him to this day. He has suffered through layoffs, both due to Covid-19 and otherwise. No matter how old a person is, parental support (mental and financial) is necessary. Even when happy moments occurred in his life, he had no parents to share his joy with. He celebrated his bar mitzvah alone and has lived alone in the world since he came of age.After filing an appeal to the authorities 7 years ago and being denied assistance, Alon had to take out loans over the years just to survive.

Terrorists infiltrated the Egyptian border and managed to take over a bus that was transporting workers to work.<br/><br/>That day, Alon’s* father rode that bus as he did every day. But this time, his usual bus ride took a tragic turn. He was held hostage and was eventually murdered by the terrorists.<br/><br/>Alon’s father was his only parent when he died. His mother had died shortly before, after a long battle with cancer.<br/><br/>It seems symbolic that his father, who acted as both father and mother to his family, was killed on the Mothers’ Bus.<br/><br/>The hostages that did not perish said that Alon’s father was a hero, and sacrificed his life rescuing the women that were on the bus as the driver opened the doors and fled. His father was left alone to deal with the horror, and he acted nobly.<br/><br/>Alon’s father was far from being ready to die. He was just 39, towards the end of his doctorate studies in laser welding. Many of his coworkers said that he would be the next CEO of the company.<br/><br/>This and many other things didn’t happen. Alon and his brothers didn’t get to see their father advance in his career or see his children and grandchildren grow. Alon and his two brothers were very small at the time, and they lost the only remaining parent they had. They were left with no one and were put into foster care. <br/><br/>The difficulties Alon faced after experiencing loss at such a young age, are exactly the same as the orphans included in the 2012 Compensation Law for Animosity Orphans.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,Today marks VFI’s 30th anniversary!\n\nAs Barry and I were driving to Jerusalem not long ago, we passed the street where our office used to be 35 years ago. Memories flooded back of our early days in publishing journals, magazines, and various publications. We enjoyed every moment of our work, but the situation in Israel was becoming increasingly difficult. Terrorist attacks were on the rise, and the call to \"comfort my people\" echoed in our ears. We realized that we must take the initiative and open a new chapter in our pursuits.The experience we gained in the business world prepared us for what was to come. In 1994, we officially registered Vision for Israel. Our vision was to support and rehabilitate the vulnerable populations in Israeli society, including new immigrants, Holocaust survivors, the elderly, lone soldiers, and those living below the poverty line. The distress of these communities and the need for emergency and rescue support were close to our hearts. We knew we had to act.Our journey has been one of love and commitment. In 1996, we faced the brutal reality of radical Islamic terrorism, which only deepened our resolve to be prepared for emergencies and to offer a helping hand. This shared vision between Barry and me was driven by a deep sense of purpose and a desire to be in the right place at the right time.In February 1996, we visited families who had lost their loved ones to hostilities. In 1998, we opened the Joseph Storehouse, our operations center in the Judean hills. It was a miracle in itself. By 2009, we had managed to purchase a lot to build a permanent home for Vision for Israel. Construction began in 2012, and in 2018, we entered the Millennium Center, the heart of our activities.\n\nReflecting on these memories, we are filled with gratitude. The inner feeling was that we should be prepared for emergencies in times of distress and lend a helping hand. The importance of being in a position to provide solutions in difficult times was clear to us. This drive was rooted in love and a desire to be in the right place at the right time.Over the past thirty years, Vision for Israel has distributed millions of shekels and provided aid to millions of people. We've supported hundreds of thousands of children and tens of thousands of lone soldiers. In times of emergency, we've supplied life-saving equipment to rescue teams and medical centers, including over 260 safety shelters, 8 ambulances, and a bloodmobile for collecting blood donations.We remember the initial days of Vision for Israel, registering as a nonprofit — feeling satisfaction despite not fully understanding the journey ahead. The unanimity and unity from everyone around us fueled our mission. The connection between our supporters worldwide and those in need was a bond we couldn't have anticipated.The path was challenging but filled with profound moments. In February 1996, our hearts broke as we visited families who had lost their loved ones to terrorism. Despite the pain, these visits strengthened our resolve. The opening of the Joseph Storehouse in 1998 marked a significant milestone. It was more than a warehouse; it was a beacon of hope.In 2009, securing a lot to build a permanent home for Vision for Israel was another miracle. The construction that began in 2012 and the completion of the Millennium Center in 2018 symbolized the growth and stability of our mission. This center became the heart of our activities, a place where love and support emanate daily.It's impossible to count and measure the donations and support that went out from Vision for Israel to all the recipients, the organizations, and the thousands of people who received aid each year. The impact is immeasurable, not just in numbers but in the lives touched and transformed.Love knows no boundaries, no numbers, no time. Thirty years is a long time, full of experiences and events, but most importantly, full of love. As we reflect on these three decades, we are filled with gratitude for the support and generosity that have made our work possible.Join us in continuing this journey of love and support. Your donation can make a real difference in the lives of those in need. Click here to donate. Thank you for standing with us and for being part of our Vision for Israel family.\n\nShalom and blessings,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,The hostilities that have marked our country have broken many families and plagued them with loss. Shmuel is one such victim. When he was five years old, Shmuel’s family was attacked by terrorists and in one tragic moment, he lost his father.Without their father, Shmuel’s family spiraled into sorrow and poverty. And Shmuel is not alone — hundreds of children throughout Israel carry the burden of similar trauma and the ensuing financial hardships. When children such as Shmuel reach the age of their Bar or Bat Mitzvah, the families often do not have the means or mental strength to host a Bar or Bat Mitzvah celebration. That’s where we’ve found a way to help. Every year, Vision for Israel organizes a Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebration for over 60 children who have been victims of terror. It is our honor to give these boys and girls a celebration to share with their families, who have suffered so much.Shmuel and the other children will enjoy an elaborate meal, generous gifts, and a meaningful ceremony at the President of Israel’s official house. We are thrilled to be able to offer such a joyous day, as we take them in the Old City of Jerusalem, show them the history, archeology, bringing a true meaning of who they are (past and present) and plant a hope for their own future. It is a privilege and an honor that we all can be a blessing in their lives. Each Bar or Bat Mitzvah child will receive a gift package valued at $850, which will include an iPad, and other special gifts. Thank you for being a part of the Vision for Israel community and contributing to this event. It truly feels like a victory against the darkness and evil.We pray that you will continue to join us in our support for vital programs for young men like Shmuel, and we welcome your contributions.May the Lord bless and keep you.Shalom from your friends,Barry, Batya, and the VFI Team\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

They exist between believers of the same faith, people who work together, pray in the same synagogue or the same church, serve in the same army unit, attend the same school—even family members living in the same house.Peace can be difficult to see sometimes. Though we trust in God to bring us peace, it is easy to get distracted by the pain and suffering that surrounds us. Often we lose sight of peace and instead find ourselves stuck in a place of distress.The Lord knows our minds and hearts. He understands that to be human means that we will wander from His peace, and head into times of worry. Matt. 6:25 “Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life”. Yeshua knows that His words can bring us back to His peace.We are called to replace anxiety with prayer and thankfulness:\n\nIn Romans 5:1-4 He tells us:\n\nHere we see God’s promise—that our suffering has a purpose. The pain and anguish we face bring us perseverance and that same perseverance is required to have true faith in God. Our perseverance in all things will set us free, and bring us closer to Him.While this perseverance is righteous, it sometimes feels at odds with our understanding of God’s peace. Therefore we must consider: “What does peace look like in a time of uncertainty, distrust, and insecurity; where will we find God’s peace in these dark times; and how does perseverance create peace here on earth?”We must take an active role in our faith. We must persevere to create His peace here on earth, even when the world around us is anything but peaceful.In Hebrew, the word for peace is “shalom,” and shalem (which has the same root letters as “shalom”) means “whole.” We are made whole when we have peace, and we have peace through faith in God, and our cooperation with His will here on earth.For 27 years Vision for Israel worked with her partners to bring peace and wholeness to the disadvantaged and downtrodden in Israel. Those who have suffered from violence, hatred, abuse, and abject poverty.The ongoing work also brings peace and protection from rocket attacks in highly populated areas. As we pray for spiritual peace, we are also building physical protections with mobile shelters around areas of high conflict. Each mobile concrete shelter costs $12,000. As we continue to bring comfort to many who are struggling in other areas and walks of life here in Israel, our hope is for our friends and partners to participate in whatever way they can to restore the peace that passes all understanding. In times like the present, when we are all being greatly tested, we must persevere against darkness and create peace in our hearts. We must bring peace to our families, friends, and community. Today, as ever, we ask that you continue your partnership with us, as we persevere toward a more just and peaceful Israel—and bring Shalom to the world.Serving with His Shalom,Batya & Barry\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Unfortunately, this is Ronen’s story and thousands of other Israelis who have also lost loved ones and experienced horrific trauma due to hatred and terrorism.When Ronen was 8 years old, he and his family were on their way to a family reunion for the weekend. Before they knew it, murderous terrorists who were on the hunt to kill Israeli citizens surrounded their car. They began throwing stones at the car and then began shooting at them. In a second, Ronen lost both his parents and found himself bleeding in the back seat, along with his brother. Ronen and his brother survived with injuries. However, the injuries to their bodies were nothing compared to the deep wounds that were left in their hearts from losing their parents in such a horrific way. Ronen underwent difficult and lengthy rehabilitation processes, and today he is 25 years old and has managed to recover. Ronen has completed his military service here in Israel and is now in need of support to advance and learn a profession in the field of social work. Tens of thousands of Israelis of all religions and ages have undergone difficult and lengthy rehabilitation processes to help them overcome the trauma of terrorism and hatred. This severe trauma can paralyze people, making them helpless and mentally debilitated. These people were once living a normal life, but because of the trauma they experienced, their world has completely turned upside down. Fear and trauma can deeply affect a person’s mind, body, and soul. So, how do we support people who have been physically and mentally harmed by severe acts of terrorism and hatred? Since 1996, Vision for Israel has been offering assistance to these victims. VFI has impacted many Israelis whose lives have been ruined and who have been deeply wounded by the loss of loved ones due to terrorism. We have stood in the gap by providing for their needs, meeting and embracing them, and supporting them in many practical ways. We believe that caring for these people is a powerful way to overcome destruction, hatred, and evil!Ronen is just one of the hundreds of students who have received and will continue to receive support for higher education studies. This year VFI plans to invest in the future of 60 Israeli students in their pursuit of higher education. Our goal is the raise $30,000 to invest in the lives of these students, which will greatly impact the future of Israel. Now is the time to support the advancement of those Israelis who want to rehabilitate, overcome, and become valuable citizens that impact the nation of Israel!Will you join us in making an impact on the future of Israel by investing in the higher education of these young Israelis who are choosing to overcome the trauma of terrorism and hatred?

When a child walks into class without the tools their classmates have, their sense of self-worth is often the first thing to suffer.

And this year marks a powerful milestone: 25 years since we first launched this initiative. Since then, thanks to friends like you, we’ve been able to distribute over 300,000 fully stocked backpacks to children in need.Each backpack is packed with love and care to help each child start the year strong. But more than that, it carries a message: You are not forgotten. You are loved.We are currently preparing for our 2025 distribution, and as we gauge the scope of the need, we know this year may be one of the greatest yet. Families continue to reel from economic strain, regional conflict, and displacement. The need is real—and growing.As we celebrate Israel’s 77th year of independence, will you help shape the future by investing in its children? Just $45 provides a complete backpack for one child. That’s $45 to change a child’s experience of school—and maybe even their life.Your generosity gives more than school supplies—it gives hope. It shows these precious children that they are part of Israel’s story and that their future matters. Give now to provide a backpack of hope (dedicate your donation to Educational Advancement).Thank you for standing with us—for 31 years of impact and a future still unfolding.

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nJoin us for this week's reading of Parashat Vayakhel, which means 'to assemble/congregate'. We will take a look at God's desire to dwell amongst us in the book of Exodus (35:1-38:20). We’ll discover the link between God's commandment to rest, the building of the Tabernacle, and how Yeshua paved the way to make His home within us (Acts 1:4).In this Parasha, God asks Moses to assemble the people of Israel to receive instructions for building the Tabernacle. A tent of meeting in which God would speak to Moses and communicate His will to the people. Moses is asking them to contribute free will gifts to build a very special tabernacle for God’s glory. Skilled and anointed craftsmen are called to complete the work of the tabernacle.\n\nThe Parasha starts with a very important commandment in Exodus 35:1-3. Moses assembles the people and instructs them about the holiness of the Sabbath and commands them to limit their work to only six days a week:\"Then Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, \"These are the words which the LORD has commanded you to do: Work shall be done for six days, but the seventh day shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of rest to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it shall be put to death. You shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings on the Sabbath day.\"\n\nAfter 400 years of slavery in Egypt, the people of Israel didn't know how to trust God to provide for them. They were crushed beneath the heavy hand of labor, and rest was a foreign concept, not in line with their deeply engrained slave mentality.\n\nGod desired to dwell amongst His people, to become their home and be their God. Although the people of Israel were no longer slaves in Egypt, they were also not yet in the promised land. God's solution for this in-between period was to build a tabernacle. The tabernacle was a 'tent of meeting' where He would meet with His people and speak to Moses.The people of Israel were then asked to contribute to the building of the tabernacle, each according to the generosity of their heart in Exodus 35:4-8:\n\n\"Moses said to all the congregation of the people of Israel, \"This is the thing that the Lord has commanded. Take from among you a contribution to the Lord. Whoever is of a generous heart, let him bring the Lord's contribution: gold, silver, and bronze; blue and purple and scarlet yarns and fine twined linen; goats' hair, tanned rams' skins, and goatskins; acacia wood, oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.\"\n\nSoon enough, the contributions came flooding in. People gave their jewelry, precious wood, fine linens, spices, oils, and more.The people of Israel responded to God's invitation with open hearts and generosity. The abundance of free will gifts was so plentiful that Moses had to instruct the people to stop giving since they collected enough!\n\nNo house can be built without capable builders to faithfully lay down the foundations and fill its interiors. God then calls Bezalel, a skilled craftsman, to build his dwelling place in Exodus 35:30-33:\n\n“See, the Lord has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, with intelligence, with knowledge, and with all craftsmanship, to devise artistic designs, to work in gold and silver and bronze, in cutting stones for setting, and in carving wood, for work in every skilled craft.”\n\nBetzalel was called to use his skills to build the tabernacle in all its splendor - but he didn't work alone. God also put His spirit in other skilled artisans to complete the work. Paying attention to every detailed instruction, they sewed curtains from fine linen, crafted the ark of the covenant, and overlaid furniture with gold. Together they used their hand and God-given gifts to serve and fill God's dwelling place with every precious thing.\n\nIf there was only one place in which God would meet with His people in the past, Yeshua was about to change that forever. After He went to the cross, forgiveness for all was available, and sin could no longer separate God's children from Him. Through this act of redemption, the Holy Spirit could now dwell in every willing heart. While Yeshua appeared to the disciples for 40 days after His resurrection, He left them with this comforting gift of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit:\n\n\"And while they were gathered together, He commanded them: “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift the Father promised, which you have heard Me discuss.\" - Acts 1:4\n\nThe people of Israel will never again be limited to a physical tent to meet with God as Yeshua decided to make His home in us - an eternal dwelling place within the hearts of His children to guide, comfort, and encourage them.\n\nFrom the dawn of time, God desired to dwell amongst His people and give them rest. At the assembling of the people of Israel at Mt. Sinai God gave instructions. He reminded His children just how important it was to rest on the Sabbath and keep it holy - keeping them safe from ever returning to slavery again.He then desired to build a tabernacle, a place where He could dwell amongst His people. No longer a seemingly aloof or distant God but a God who desires nearness with those He loves— comforting a people wandering in the desert, searching for a home.Just like the people of Israel contributed their own possessions to build a tabernacle, we treat our hearts the same - a place worthy of the Holy Spirit. The generosity of their hearts to contribute to the building of the tabernacle paints an inspiring picture for us today to offer ourselves as living sacrifices (Romans 12:1).Each person has been given talents and skills to serve with build God's kingdom in creative ways. Just as Bezalel was anointed to build the tabernacle, we too are called to volunteer our gifts and work with our hands and serve.As we reflect upon this Parasha, we thank God for giving us rest and gifting us with the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. God, please cleanse our hearts and fill us anew with your goodness.

      "title": "Parashat Achrei Mot-Kedoshim — Be Holy as I Am Holy",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThis Shabbat we’ll be studying two parashot, Achrei Mot and Kedoshim which arefound in Leviticus 16:1-20:27. The double Torah portions of Achrei Mot and Kedoshim can be succinctly summarized as the Torah’s “holiness chapters.” Leviticus chapter 16 addresses the holiest man in the world – the High Priest – concerning the holiest day of the year – Yom Kippur – and his service carried out in the holiest place on earth – The Holy of Holies. Not to be outdone, the next parashah is called Kedoshim which means “holy ones,” and begins with a very famous verse about holiness:\n\nThe opening passage in Parshat Kedoshim begins with the commandment to be holy as God is holy (Lev. 19:2). Jesus alludes to this verse in his famous Sermon on the Mount, but significantly escalates the imperative: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48). This is one command that many would argue is impossible to keep. How can we be perfect if we are fallible by nature? How can we be holy like God if He is most holy? Much of what should be understood about holiness can be derived from the word’s Hebrew etymology. The Hebrew word for holy is קָדוֹשׁ (kadosh), which carries the connotation of being ‘set apart’ or different from what could be considered ordinary or mundane.For example, the Temple is holy because it is set apart from every other edifice in the world as it hosted the presence of God. Jerusalem is called the “holy city” because it has the distinction of housing the place of worship. And Eretz Israel is called the “holy land” because it is central to God’s covenant with the Jewish people. All of these are called holy because they are distinct and dedicated to God’s purpose. According to the Bible, the process of becoming holy or making something holy is called sanctification. Perhaps the most famous act of sanctification or “setting apart” takes place every Friday evening in Jewish homes, where a blessing of kiddush is said over a cup of wine, and a verse from the creation account is quoted:\n\n“And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy – having ceased on it from all the work of creation that God had done” - Gen. 2:3\n\nLike Israel, Jerusalem, and the Temple, the Sabbath is holy. The Holy Shabbat derives its distinction from creation because, unlike the other six days, God ceased from creating and dedicated it, later entrusting its safekeeping to the Jewish people for all time (Ex. 31:16-17):\n\nSo Bnei-Yisrael is to keep the Shabbat, to observe the Shabbat throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.It is a sign between Me and Bnei-Yisrael forever, for in six days Adonai made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and rested.\n\nWith this most basic principle of holiness explained, we can now begin to understand God’s imperative to His people concerning holiness. The first and most obvious question we should ask is what it means to be holy. Or framed another way: What is it about God’s holiness that we are commanded to emulate? In the context of the Torah portion – Parshat Kedoshim, the command to be holy as God is holy introduces a long list of instructions that would seem to define the standard for holy living.For example, in the very next verse, God repeats the imperative to revere our parents and to guard His Sabbaths (Lev. 19:3): “Each one of you is to respect his mother and his father, and keep My Shabbatot. I am Adonai your God.” In verse 4, He admonishes the Israelites to shun idolatry: “Do not turn to idols, or make molten gods for yourselves. I am Adonai your God.” Interestingly, these three instructions carry over from the Ten Commandments, which serve as categorical preludes to the rest of the Torah’s 613 precepts.Throughout the rest of the chapter (19:9-37), the Torah provides instructions about the responsibility that mutual covenant members have to each other, with v. 18 comprising the most famous line that encapsulates all the others:\n\n“Love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.”\n\nThe implication for holiness is that Israel must be solely consecrated to God and entirely devoted to each other for the purpose of being a light to the nations. For this reason, God demands Israel to be distinct from the rest of the world: “You must not do as they do in Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not do as they do in Canaan, where I am bringing you” (Lev. 18:3).Toward the end of Parshat Kedoshim, after providing a list of positive commandments in chapter 19, and a list of negative commandments in chapter 20, God again reminds the people:\n\n“You shall not follow the practices of the nation that I am driving out before you. For it is because they did all these things that I abhorred them (Lev. 20:23).”\n\nAs the precursor to all of this, the holiness statement in 19:3 is God’s admonishment to be set apart. Just as God is distinguished and unique in the universe, so too are His people challenged to be distinct and uncorrupted by the world around them.\n\nThe same standard is incumbent upon us today. As disciples of Yeshua, we are called to be different from the rest of humanity and live lives that rise above – for instance – the illicit sexual relationships described in Leviticus 18; because according to the correct understanding of holiness, whenever there is a separation from immorality, there is also holiness.In this regard, Peter quotes Lev. 19:2 in his epistle when he says:\n\n“As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance. But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do…” - 1 Peter 1:16\n\nHoliness does not necessarily mean that we will be perfect, but the Torah also assures us that if we are faithful in the pursuit of perfection, we will inevitably be distinct and achieve holiness (Deut. 16:20): Justice, justice you must pursue, so that you may live and possess the land that Adonai your God is giving you. In the context of Yeshua’s statement in the Sermon on the Mount, this is what he meant when he said to be perfect. The preceding verses establish his point:\n\n“If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that?”\n\nHINT: Be different! Rise above the ordinary!\n\n“And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” - Mat. 5:46-48\n\nThe message is clear: We must strive to emulate God in every facet of our life. Perfection lies in the motivation of our heart — to see the world the way God sees it, and to make every effort to walk in stride with His narrow path.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",
      "content_html": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\" style=\"color:white\">Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War</p><p>This Shabbat we’ll be studying two parashot, <em>Achrei Mot </em>and <em>Kedoshim </em>which arefound in Leviticus 16:1-20:27. The double Torah portions of <em>Achrei Mot </em>and <em>Kedoshim </em>can be succinctly summarized as the Torah’s “holiness chapters.” Leviticus chapter 16 addresses the holiest man in the world – the High Priest – concerning the holiest day of the year – Yom Kippur – and his service carried out in the holiest place on earth – The Holy of Holies. Not to be outdone, the next parashah is called <em>Kedoshim </em>which means “holy ones,” and begins with a very famous verse about holiness: </p><p>The opening passage in <em>Parshat Kedoshim </em>begins with the commandment to be holy as God is holy (Lev. 19:2). Jesus alludes to this verse in his famous Sermon on the Mount, but significantly escalates the imperative: “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48). This is one command that many would argue is impossible to keep. How can we be perfect if we are fallible by nature? How can we be holy like God if He is most holy? <br/><br/>Much of what should be understood about holiness can be derived from the word’s Hebrew etymology. The Hebrew word for holy is קָדוֹשׁ (<em>kadosh</em>), which carries the connotation of being ‘set apart’ or different from what could be considered ordinary or mundane.<br/><br/>For example, the Temple is holy because it is set apart from every other edifice in the world as it hosted the presence of God. Jerusalem is called the “holy city” because it has the distinction of housing the place of worship. And Eretz Israel is called the “holy land” because it is central to God’s covenant with the Jewish people. <br/><br/>All of these are called holy because they are distinct and dedicated to God’s purpose. According to the Bible, the process of becoming holy or making something holy is called sanctification. Perhaps the most famous act of sanctification or “setting apart” takes place every Friday evening in Jewish homes, where a blessing of <em>kiddush </em>is said over a cup of wine, and a verse from the creation account is quoted: </p><p><em>“And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy – having ceased on it from all the work of creation that God had done” - Gen. 2:3</em></p><p>Like Israel, Jerusalem, and the Temple, the Sabbath is holy. The Holy Shabbat derives its distinction from creation because, unlike the other six days, God ceased from creating and dedicated it, later entrusting its safekeeping to the Jewish people for all time (Ex. 31:16-17):</p><p><em>So Bnei-Yisrael is to keep the Shabbat, to observe the Shabbat throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.It is a sign between Me and Bnei-Yisrael forever, for in six days Adonai made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day He ceased from work and rested.</em></p><p>With this most basic principle of holiness explained, we can now begin to understand God’s imperative to His people concerning holiness.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nJoin us for this week's reading of Parashat Behar from Leviticus 25:1 - 26:2, which means 'on the mountain'. We will explore the generosity of God and the instructions he gives to the Israelites regarding their crops, and fields.Through this Parasha, we will learn of the just character of God to take care of the poor and the foreigner amongst us and how when we trust him and allow the fields to rest (as we do on a Sabbath day), He multiplies what we gave Him as an offering.\n\nThe people of Israel have assembled on Mt. Sinai to hear God's instructions regarding the land he was to give them in Israel. He starts by setting his standards for rest just as He did in the garden of Eden, stating in Leviticus 25:1-4:\n\n\"The Lord said to Moses at Mount Sinai, \"Speak to the Israelites and say to them: 'When you enter the land I am going to give you, the land itself must observe a sabbath to the Lord. For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops. But in the seventh year the land is to have a year of sabbath rest, a sabbath to the Lord. Do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards.“\n\nWhy is rest so important to God? After the fall, the ground would not easily yield its fruits (Genesis 3:17-19), and man would have to work by the sweat of his brow.God's original intent for the Garden of Eden was for humanity to enjoy it without worrying about food or provision. He also commanded them to rest on the seventh day of the week, calling that day 'Sabbath' which in Hebrew means 'to strike, to seize'. In Leviticus, God does not only extend his commandment to rest on the Sabbath but also extends it to the soil of the ground and the crops that they yield.He then introduces them to an even greater standard of rest called the Jubilee in which they were to (verse 8): “Count off seven sabbath years—seven times seven years—so that the seven sabbath years amount to a period of forty-nine years.”He explains that the (verses 11-12): “fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you; do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines. For it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you; eat only what is taken directly from the fields.”Furthermore, he explains that in the year of Jubilee, each should return to their own property.\n\nGod then instructs the people how to handle their land and property and to fear the Lord while dealing fairly with the poor.God does not only command rest to the capable amongst the people of Israel or rest to the soil, but also to the restless of society – the poor and the needy.Imagine being in a position where you have no means to provide for yourself; every day is a struggle, and your only way to survive is to beg for kindness and mercy. For the poor and the needy, there is no rest for the body or soul; neither do they have anything to offer to their children and no inheritance to pass down.Although they did not toil, strive or sweat for the fields to yield their crops, nor did they offer anything in order to be able to purchase its goods, God deems them worthy of receiving and entering into rest (Leviticus 25:35-36):\n\n\"If any of your fellow Israelites become poor and are unable to support themselves among you, help them as you would a foreigner and stranger, so they can continue to live among you. Do not take interest or any profit from them, but fear your God, so that they may continue to live among you.\"\n\nIn Israel today, many farmers who work the ground take a \"Shnat Shmita\", a 'year off' in which they do not raise crops. Oftentimes they will put up a sign on the edge of their field by the side of the road which reads: \"We keep the seventh year\".The world might think taking the seventh year off to be a foolish desicion. In today's economy, which knows no rest and the competition is fierce, many business owners or farmers cannot afford to take such long breaks, adding on to the pressure of their daily grind in an ever-changing and never stable economy.It is a great risk to take, and yet for those who put their trust in God, the greater risk would be to be self-sufficient and independent of Him since striving leads to unrest.For those who fear they will be without or find themselves lacking, God understands their concern and worry, and being kind to us in our weakness, offers a promise. In this promise, He reminds us that if we do what is right, He will command blessings to be upon us (verses 18-22):\n\n\"Follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws, and you will live safely in the land. Then the land will yield its fruit, and you will eat your fill and live there in safety. You may ask, ‘What will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops?’ I will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years. While you plant during the eighth year, you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in.”\n\nThe temptation to worry is understandable, and yet God offers a greater solution to our need for food, clothes, and housing. In Matthew 6:26-33 Yeshua patiently reminds us to cast our worries on Him instead of carrying the burden alone:\n\n\"Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?...But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.\"\n\nWe encourage you to read these verses and dwell on them. Focus on God's kingdom and the spiritual or tangible soil and field of your life and heart, and see where God is asking you to rest and to lend to those in need.As He promised, if you rest, he will make sure that you are overflowing with blessings far beyond your investment, work, or toil.As we reflect on this Parasha, we thank God for giving us the grace to trust Him fully and to lay our worries for provision on Him. Let's pray together:“God, please help us to put our trust in you and rely on your loving-kindness and trust daily in your provision. Help us follow your instructions in faith. Guide us to share with those who need your care the most.”\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "title": "Parashat Devarim: From the Wilderness to the Promised Land",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe Hebrew title for the book of Deuteronomy is Devarim (lit. words) and is taken from the first verse of the book which begins with, “These are the words (devarim) that Moses spoke…” The weekly Torah portion bears the same title and covers Deuteronomy 1:1-3:22.Deuteronomy reads like one continuous dialogue and constitutes Moses’ parting words to the nation in the final weeks of his life. The Sages of Israel referred to the book as Moses’ “Mishna Torah” (repetition/explanation of the Torah) because, in truth, the book is Moses’ final appeal to the nation, in his own words, to keep the laws and values that God had already instructed them throughout the wilderness experience (Exodus-Numbers). Moses’ address contains rebuke, dire warnings against potential pitfalls, and the promise that no matter how far the Jewish nation may drift from God’s direction, the door to repentance and reconciliation is always open (Deuteronomy 30:1-6). Thus, the instructions repeated by Moses in Deuteronomy are communicated verbally from his perspective: “Moses began explaining this Torah, saying…” (Deuteronomy 1:5-6) – and represent Moses’ vision of what it would take for the people to remain strong and courageous, and faithful as they prepared to inhabit the Promised Land.\n\nAs Moses delivered his “words” to the nation, he did so with the understanding that he himself would not join his people in their conquest. He knew that life in the Promised Land would be completely different from the life they had known in the Wilderness, where God’s constant presence and daily miracles that accompanied them had become the norm. They would no longer enjoy the daily provision of manna that they received for 40 years but would have to plant and sow by the sweat of their brow and depend on God’s provision of rain to produce their food. Their new life would require strength and self-discipline to avoid the snares and temptations of their pagan neighbors and false prophets. Furthermore, they would need to establish courts and a government, forge social relationships, and develop the means to provide for and protect the poor, widow, foreigner, and orphan. In verse 8, Moses levels with the people and explains that the challenge of securing the Land was a foregone conclusion. God would fight the battles on Israel’s behalf. The only thing that was left for the embryonic nation to do is to move forward in faith and embrace the free gift of inheritance that God had prepared for them:\n\nרְאֵ֛ה נָתַ֥תִּי לִפְנֵיכֶ֖ם אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ בֹּ֚אוּ וּרְשׁ֣וּ אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ\n\nאֲשֶׁ֣ר נִשְׁבַּ֣ע יְ֠הֹוָ֠ה לַאֲבֹ֨תֵיכֶ֜ם לְאַבְרָהָ֨ם לְיִצְחָ֤ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹב֙ לָתֵ֣ת לָהֶ֔ם וּלְזַרְעָ֖ם אַחֲרֵיהֶֽם׃\n\n\"See, I place the land at your disposal. Go, take possession of the land that Hashem swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to assign to them and to their heirs after them.\" – Deuteronomy 1:8\n\nAccording to Moses, the inheritance of the Promised Land was a gift established on the grounds of God’s grace and favor for the merit of the Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. As Moses would explain later in his discourse: “It is not because of your righteousness and rectitude that you will be able to possess their country; but… to fulfill the oath that Hashem made to your fathers… (Deuteronomy 9:5).”The notion that God’s favor is procured on behalf of a single worthy individual is a major theme throughout the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), and serves as a basis for understanding the role of Messiah as a guarantor in the New Testament (Hebrews 7:2). The book of Genesis as a baseline is replete with examples of individuals who lived righteous lives by faith, and God extended their merits to justify a multitude. For example, Noah was considered righteous in his generation for having done everything God commanded (Genesis 6:9, 22) and for his sake, the human race was spared. Abraham was considered righteous for his faith (Genrdid 15:6); and so too – Isaac and Jacob – and because of God’s love for them (Romans 11:28), countless generations of Jews and non-Jews from every nation are, and have been blessed (Genesis 12:3, 22:18).\n\n“As far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs.” – Romans 11:28\n\nBy the beginning of the First Century CE, the notion that God would prosper the nation on behalf of a righteous agent was well-established in Judaism. With this general purview in mind, Moses reminds the nation that there is nothing they could have done or could do to deserve the gift that God placed before them in keeping with the words: “natati lifneihem – I am giving it before you (v. 8).” In other words, just reach out and grab it, it is a free gift!\n\nThe foremost Jewish commentator, Rashi, comments on Deuteronomy 8:1 as follows:The land which the Lord swore unto your fathers… Why does Moses further mention their names: to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob? But it is to suggest the following: The merit of Abraham would itself suffice, that of Isaac would itself suffice, that of Jacob would itself suffice, that I should give the land to you (cf. Sifrei Devarim 8:1)Once again, the commentary seeks to reinforce the understanding that there is nothing else that Israel could have done or anything they could do to have received the gift. The inheritance was a measure of God’s favor i.e., grace, and Israel received it not by their own merit, but by the individual merit and individual righteousness of their fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Yet, as wonderful as this gift is, it still presents a dilemma: If the people are receiving an inheritance as a gift thanks to God’s love for the fathers, then why do the people have to fight for the Land? In addressing this dilemma, the classic commentators further draw on the subtleties of the Hebrew grammar in v. 8 to explain the underlying reason for why Israel was delayed in entering the Land in the first place:\n\nרְאֵ֛ה נָתַ֥תִּי לִפְנֵיכֶ֖ם אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ \"See, I place the land before you.\" – Deuteronomy 1:8a\n\nVerse 8 begins with an imperative addressed to the nation in the singular: “re’eh – see!” The immediate statement that follows is the object of the imperative: “I have given the land before you.” However, the way in which these lines are communicated in the Hebrew text produces an unbalanced statement: The imperative is addressed in the singular (re’eh, not the pl., re’u), while the statements that follow are addressed to the same audience in the plural (lifneichem, not the sing., lifneicha):It is worth noting for non-Hebrew speakers that, unlike the English language, second-person imperatives and personal pronouns are distinguished between the singular and the plural in Hebrew. Furthermore, while the switch from a singular address to a plural address mid-sentence is not impossible, it is striking and beckons further question and investigation. The classic Jewish commentaries make special note of this unique linguistic feature and deduce some relevant conclusions for the present day that are based on the circumstances of the Israelite nation that stood at the edge of the Wilderness. The 17th-century Talmudist, Chaim ibn Attar (also known as Or HaChaim), deduces the following conclusion:“Behold (sg.), I have set the land before you (pl.);” The Torah switches from the singular re’eh, to the plural lifneichem, “before you (pl)”, because when it comes to looking at the land they were all alike. However, each individual Jew was different from his brethren in character, mentality, etc. Similarly, the nature of taking possession of the land and what it meant to each Israelite differed, so the verse's balance is in the plural.Or Ha’Chaim’s observation bares a universal truth that is applicable to our own times: As individuals, we each have the capacity to think and express ourselves in our own unique way. The modern State of Israel is undoubtedly diverse as the world itself. And the Messianic Jewish community resembles that diversity as a microcosm of the Jewish world. However, the greatness of any civilization comes when individual parts are assembled and working together towards a common goal. For the rabbis, they interpreted Moses’ diverse manners of address as indicative of Israel’s corporeal unity. When it came to the Promised Land, every Jew agreed that it was important. But when it came to understanding their covenant responsibility and relationship to the Land of Israel, their perspectives differed among individuals. This observation hearkens to the very reason that Israel did not enter the Land in the first place: From the onset of their exodus from Egypt, and when God told them to move on from Mount Horeb, they were not united in purpose and vision. The importance of our own time cannot be understated. The Apostles of Yeshua had much to say about the importance of individual entities working together to comprise a single part, and the necessity of unity in vision to manifest God’s kingdom as an earthly reality:\n\n\"Just as a body, though one, has many parts, but all its many parts form one body, so it is with Messiah. For we were all baptized by one Spirit so as to form one body – whether Jews or Gentiles, slave or free – and we were all given the one Spirit to drink. Even so, the body is not made up of one part but of many\" - 1 Corinthians 12:12-14\n\nHerein lies the necessity to fight for the Land in tandem with receiving it: The process of acquiring God’s inheritance was designed to spur the development of unity. Part of Israel’s journey through the Wilderness to the Promised Land was to unite the hearts of the people to accomplish God’s purposes through them:\n\nWhen Israel’s vision was out of line, the Wilderness trek was extended and their glorious entry to Eretz Israel was delayed.The same can be said of our present exile and the unity of the Jewish people and the Messianic body. What is it that prevents the ushering of God’s kingdom in our midst, or the effectiveness of the Messianic Jewish community in testifying the message of Yeshua? The answer is simple, by and large, we are not united in our vision and we don’t agree on what it means to be Jewish or to follow Yeshua. In the meantime, the process that we are walking out as individual parts and being assembled is designed for us to learn unity through trial and experience. By overcoming obstacles and learning from mistakes in humility, we grow into the “house that is being built together for God’s glory” (Ephesians 2:19-22) and hasten the manifested reality of God’s kingdom in our midst.

      "content_html": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\" style=\"color:white\">Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War</p><p>The Hebrew title for the book of Deuteronomy is <em>Devarim </em>(lit. words) and is taken from the first verse of the book which begins with, “These are the words (<em>devarim</em>) that Moses spoke…” The weekly Torah portion bears the same title and covers Deuteronomy 1:1-3:22.<br/><br/>Deuteronomy reads like one continuous dialogue and constitutes Moses’ parting words to the nation in the final weeks of his life. The Sages of Israel referred to the book as Moses’ “<em>Mishna Torah” </em>(repetition/explanation of the Torah) because, in truth, the book is Moses’ final appeal to the nation, in his own words, to keep the laws and values that God had already instructed them throughout the wilderness experience (Exodus-Numbers). <br/><br/>Moses’ address contains rebuke, dire warnings against potential pitfalls, and the promise that no matter how far the Jewish nation may drift from God’s direction, the door to repentance and reconciliation is always open (Deuteronomy 30:1-6). Thus, the instructions repeated by Moses in Deuteronomy are communicated verbally from his perspective: “Moses began explaining this Torah, saying…” (Deuteronomy 1:5-6) – and represent Moses’ vision of what it would take for the people to remain strong and courageous, and faithful as they prepared to inhabit the Promised Land.</p><p>As Moses delivered his “words” to the nation, he did so with the understanding that he himself would not join his people in their conquest. He knew that life in the Promised Land would be completely different from the life they had known in the Wilderness, where God’s constant presence and daily miracles that accompanied them had become the norm. They would no longer enjoy the daily provision of manna that they received for 40 years but would have to plant and sow by the sweat of their brow and depend on God’s provision of rain to produce their food. Their new life would require strength and self-discipline to avoid the snares and temptations of their pagan neighbors and false prophets. Furthermore, they would need to establish courts and a government, forge social relationships, and develop the means to provide for and protect the poor, widow, foreigner, and orphan. <br/><br/>In verse 8, Moses levels with the people and explains that the challenge of securing the Land was a foregone conclusion. God would fight the battles on Israel’s behalf. The only thing that was left for the embryonic nation to do is to move forward in faith and embrace the free gift of inheritance that God had prepared for them:</p><p>רְאֵ֛ה נָתַ֥תִּי לִפְנֵיכֶ֖ם אֶת־הָאָ֑רֶץ בֹּ֚אוּ וּרְשׁ֣וּ אֶת־הָאָ֔רֶץ </p><p>אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִשְׁבַּ֣ע יְ֠הֹוָ֠ה לַאֲבֹ֨תֵיכֶ֜ם לְאַבְרָהָ֨ם לְיִצְחָ֤ק וּֽלְיַעֲקֹב֙<br/> לָתֵ֣ת לָהֶ֔ם וּלְזַרְעָ֖ם אַחֲרֵיהֶֽם׃</p><p><em>\"See, I place the land at your disposal. Go, take possession of the land that Hashem swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to assign to them and to their heirs after them.\" </em>– Deuteronomy 1:8</p><p>According to Moses, the inheritance of the Promised Land was a gift established on the grounds of God’s grace and favor for the merit of the Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. As Moses would explain later in his discourse: “<em>It is not because of your righteousness and rectitude that you will be able to possess their country; but… to fulfill the oath that Hashem made to your fathers…</em> (Deuteronomy 9:5).”<br/><br/>The notion that God’s favor is procured on behalf of a single worthy individual is a major theme throughout the Hebrew Bible (<em>Tanakh</em>), and serves as a basis for understanding the role of Messiah as a guarantor in the New Testament (Hebrews 7:2). The book of Genesis as a baseline is replete with examples of individuals who lived righteous lives by faith, and God extended their merits to justify a multitude. For example, Noah was considered righteous in his generation for having done everything God commanded (Genesis 6:9, 22) and for his sake, the human race was spared. Abraham was considered righteous for his faith (Genrdid 15:6); and so too – Isaac and Jacob – and because of God’s love for them (Romans 11:28), countless generations of Jews and non-Jews from every nation are, and have been blessed (Genesis 12:3, 22:18). </p><p>“As far as election is concerned, they are loved on account of the patriarchs.” – Romans 11:28</p><p>By the beginning of the First Century CE, the notion that God would prosper the nation on behalf of a righteous agent was well-established in Judaism. With this general purview in mind, Moses reminds the nation that there is nothing they could have done or could do to deserve the gift that God placed before them in keeping with the words: “<em>natati lifneihem – I am giving it before you </em>(v. 8).<em>” </em>In other words, just reach out and grab it, <strong>it is a free gift!</strong></p><p>The foremost Jewish commentator, Rashi, comments on Deuteronomy 8:1 as follows:<br/><br/><strong><em>The land which the Lord swore unto your fathers</em>…</strong> Why does Moses further mention their names: to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob? But it is to suggest the following: The merit of Abraham would itself suffice, that of Isaac would itself suffice, that of Jacob would itself suffice, that I should give the land to you (cf.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nFor this week's Torah portion, we will read Parashat Ekev from Deuteronomy 7:12-11:25, which means 'Because.'In this parashah, Moses reminds the people of Israel of the covenant God made with them, the blessings they will receive by following Him, and the consequences they would bear if they forget the Lord, their God.Before entering the promised land, God, in His great wisdom, made sure the people of Israel did not fall prey to their pride, thinking that their righteousness gave them possession of the land. But will they remember all His great blessings once they get to the land flowing with milk and honey? And what is the connection between God's covenant with the Israelites and Yeshua's sacrifice on the cross?Let's explore this parashah and see how God views His covenant mercies, how Israel responded to it throughout their 40 years in the desert, and what we can learn today.\n\nGod's covenant with the people of Israel had numerous benefits. Although it would have been enough to be chosen by the God of the universe to be His people (Leviticus 26:45), God wanted to give His people a resting place from their enemies and bless them abundantly (Deuteronomy 7:12-13):\n\n\"And because you listen to these rules and keep and do them, the Lord your God will keep with you the covenant and the steadfast love that he swore to your fathers. He will love you, bless you, and multiply you. He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your wine and your oil, the increase of your herds and the young of your flock, in the land that he swore to your fathers to give you.״\n\nGod repeats multiple times in this parashah that if the people of Israel keep His covenant, He will remove their enemies from the land. They will find rest, enjoying the brooks, wheat and barley, vines and fig trees, olives, honey, and all manner of abundance, saying: \"you will lack nothing.\"But one request guarantees they will continue to enjoy all the benefits of the covenant in Deuteronomy 10:12-13:\n\n\"And now, Israel, what does the Lord your God require of you, but to fear the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and to keep the commandments and statutes of the Lord, which I am commanding you today for your good?\"\n\nThat might sound like a simple exchange — fear the Lord and receive the covenant benefits. Still, for some reason, the people of Israel often forgot the Lord their God, falling into the pitfall of pride, grumbling, disbelief, and rebellion.\n\nBefore making the journey into the promised land, God reminds His people through Moses how He forgave them every time they rebelled (as with the golden calf and at Massah and Kibroth-Hatta’avah).Why? Because He made a covenant to be their God, and staying true to his character, in His great mercy, He forgave them when Moses asked for forgiveness on their behalf (Deuteronomy 9:25-28):\n\n\"So I lay prostrate before the Lord for these forty days and forty nights, because the Lord had said he would destroy you. And I prayed to the Lord, 'O Lord God, do not destroy your people and your heritage, whom you have redeemed through your greatness, whom you have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand. Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Do not regard the stubbornness of this people, or their wickedness or their sin, lest the land from which you brought us say, \"Because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land that he promised them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to put them to death in the wilderness.\"\n\nMoses acted as a mediator between God and the people, asking God to remember the covenant He made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and forgive the people for His name's sake.He then warns them not to become conceited, thinking that God gave them the land because of their righteousness (Deuteronomy 9:4):\n\n\"Do not say in your heart, after the Lord your God has thrust them out before you, 'It is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land\".\n\nThe covenant God made with His people is the backbone of every fulfilled promise reflected in the sacrifice of Yeshua in the New Testament. Yeshua came to earth to die for a world He knew would rebel, betray, abandon and take His mercy for granted.But because of the covenant God made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Yeshua considered it a joy to seal the covenant with His blood for the eternal forgiveness of mankind.Yeshua is a mediator between God and the His people, just as Moses was.When the people of Israel sinned, Moses would meet with God, asking Him to remember His covenant. Yeshua, making a covenant in His blood, served as the ultimate sacrifice.From there, Romans 6:15-16 makes it clear that although we are forgiven through His covenant, we are not to use God's mercy as an excuse to sin:\n\n\"What then? Shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace? By no means! Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey—whether you are slaves to sin, which leads to death, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness?\"\n\nJust as God warned the people of Israel not to become conceited, Paul reminds the body of Messiah to obey God, not motivated by obligation but by grace and their desire to serve Him.Although God's covenant is eternal and His love is everlasting, this should not be a reason to wrongfully take advantage of His kindness.We are saved by God's grace, not our actions and works of obedience alone because God looks at the intention and motive of the heart.\n\nThroughout history, the people of Israel forgot God and the covenant He made with them. They paid a terrible price for forgetting that every good thing they had was because of Him.Can you recognize an area in your life where you stepped out of the bounds of God's covenant and into pride, stubbornness, or disbelief? Just as with the people of Israel, it is never too late to go to God's mercy seat, ask for forgiveness, and enter back into the safety of His protective covenant with you.Yeshua made it possible for us to enter into this eternal covenant. Let us take advantage of it so we can walk in obedience and intimacy with Him and remember that we on our own possess no righteousness apart from what God Himself grants us through the covenant made in the blood of Yeshua.Let's pray together: God, thank you for your covenant and unfailing love. Help me walk in obedience to your ways and give me the grace to continuously stay within the bounds of your everlasting promises to me.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nFor this week's Torah portion, we will be reading Parashat Matot-Masei from Numbers 30:2-36:13, which means 'Tribes-Journeys'.In this Parasha, we will explore the 40-year journey the tribes went through in the desert, the importance of our vows, following God's instructions, and making sure our words match our actions.At this point, the people of Israel are nearing the end of their 40 years of wandering in the desert and have gone through many tests and trials.God used their time of waiting to enter the promised land as the perfect opportunity to prepare them to face their enemies - but not before they learned to walk in another level of obedience and integrity.Here are three examples in which God teaches the people of Israel how their words, obedience, and actions go hand in hand with consequences, for better or worse.\n\nThe parashah starts with Moses' instructions to the heads of the tribes, explaining to them the importance of treating their vows to the Lord in reverence, taking extra caution to be fully committed:\n\n\"When a man makes a vow to the Lord or takes an oath to obligate himself by a pledge, he must not break his word but must do everything he said.\" - Numbers 30:2\n\nOften, words can be used casually and without much forethought of the potential consequences they might bring.Moses was a mediator between God and the people, and God chose him as a mouthpiece to convey his will to the people — which is a great and powerful position to be in.As a leader, he learned firsthand how important and influential his words were as he was not allowed to enter the promised land after rebuking the people at Meribah.So it is no surprise that he teaches them one of the most important lessons: your words matter, whether that is an oath, correction, or guidance. If they are used carelessly, you risk making the holy and important things profane or even leading people astray.Moses even gives examples of cases in which a person should be released from oaths and obligations. Thank God there is a solution even when we over-commit and bite off more than we can chew!\n\nGod then commands the Israelites to go to war against the Midianites, who followed Balaam's advice and enticed the Israelites to be unfaithful to the Lord:\n\n\"So Moses said to the people, ‘Arm some of your men to go to war against the Midianites so that they may carry out the Lord's vengeance on them. Send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of Israel.’\" - Numbers 31:3-4\n\nAlthough they won the battle, they disobeyed God's instructions by taking women unto themselves:\n\n\"The Israelites captured the Midianite women and children and took all the Midianite herds, flocks, and goods as plunder. They burned all the towns where the Midianites had settled, as well as all their camps.\" - Numbers 31:9-11\n\nMoses was angry since he gave them instructions, and they did not obey. He then instructed them to cleanse themselves after their disobedience. After some time, while dividing the plunder between the tribes, they understood their ways were not pleasing to the Lord and showed genuine remorse by collecting an offering to God:\n\n\"So we have brought as an offering to the Lord the gold articles each of us acquired—armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord.\" - Numbers 31:50\n\nGod wanted to give the promised land in its entirety to the people of Israel. This battle acted as preparation grounds to see whether or not they would heed his instructions when fighting against the gentile nations who possessed the land or if they would fall prey to disobedience.\n\nThe Reubenites and Gadites decided they did not want to cross the Jordan into the promised land with their people and livestock. This angered Moses, who thought they did not want to go to battle and didn't mind leaving the difficult job of conquering the land to the rest of the tribes.As they assured him they would fight with their fellow Israelites until all the other tribes had received their inheritance, Moses reiterates just how critical it is that they follow through on their obligation before the Lord:\n\n\"Then Moses said to them, ‘If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the Lord for battle and if all of you who are armed cross over the Jordan before the Lord until he has driven his enemies out before him— then when the land is subdued before the Lord, you may return and be free from your obligation to the Lord and to Israel. And this land will be your possession before the Lord...but if you fail to do this, you will be sinning against the Lord; and you may be sure that your sin will find you out. Build cities for your women and children, and pens for your flocks, but do what you have promised.’\" - Numbers 32:20-27\n\nMoses considered it a sin against the Lord if the Reubenites and Gadites did not fulfill their promises before God and urged them to take it seriously, reminding them that their own actions would hunt them down if they did not follow through.\n\nMoses recorded all the places the people of Israel stopped along the way to the promised land and reminded them to continue serving him with reverence and obedience as he has taught them in the desert for 40 years:\n\n\"On the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho the Lord said to Moses, ‘Speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you cross the Jordan into Canaan, drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you. Destroy all their carved images and their cast idols, and demolish all their high places. Take possession of the land and settle in it, for I have given you the land to possess.’\" - Numbers 30:50-53\n\nThe common thread weaved through this parashah is just how important our words and actions are to the Lord and how when we choose to submit our ways to the Lord, He will bless our steps, but when we step out of His will, we are not able to reach the promised land, the inheritance God ordained for us.The people of Israel are an example to us today of how to walk with integrity and not compromise, how to repent when we have gone astray and how to consider our steps carefully before we take them. We all act hastily sometimes and pay the consequences, but God is gracious to forgive us our sins as we repent and turn from our ways.As we reflect on Parashat Matot-Masei, we thank God for teaching us how to walk with integrity in our words, actions, and commitments.Let's pray together:\"God, please teach me how to use my words wisely and be intentional about my commitments and actions.

      "title": "Parashat Re’eh: Seeing God’s Vision",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe fourth reading of Sefer Devarim (The Book of Deuteronomy) is Parshat Re’eh (Deut. 11:26-16-17). The title of the Torah portion is taken from the first word of Moses’ address in the imperative: “See! (re’eh), I present before you today a blessing and a curse…”Parshat Re’eh inaugurates a series of three consecutive Torah portions – Re’eh, Shoftim, Ki Tetzei – that contain more commandments than any other pericope in Scripture. Until now, Moses has focused on the importance of revering Hashem; the benefit and necessity of loving God with all of one’s heart, soul, and resources; and the tools they will need as a people to adapt to their new life in the Promised Land. Within the first ten chapters of the book, most of what Moses has said has come in the form of a rebuke. Yet, even his rebuke is intended to encourage and inspire the people to greatness.\n\nThis week, Moses kicks off the trilogy by putting the commands of God into perspective, explaining that the choice of the Jewish people on whether to accept the Torah and their mission is nothing short of choosing between a blessing and a curse:The blessing: that you hearken to the commandments of the LORD, your God, that I command you today. And the curse: If you do not hearken to the commandments of the LORD, your God, and you stray from the path that I command you today, to follow gods of others, that you did not know. (Deut. 11:27-28).At this juncture in the book, Moses’ statement represents a monumental shift in focus as he moves from the “30,000-foot overview” and gets down to the “brass tax”. In the previous parashah, Moses told the people that keeping the Torah and mitzvot is key to living a prosperous life in the Holy Land. Now, Moses begins teaching specific commandments and frames the discussion with the purview of blessings and curses. Later in the book, Moses will reframe the question by equating the blessing and the curse to a choice between life and death: “See, I set before you today life and prosperity, death and adversity (Deut. 30:15).” In both bookend statements, Moses fronts the prophetic ultimatum with the singular imperative “see – re’eh.” Essentially, our Torah portion and continuing to the end of the book is all about seeing i.e., perspective. The imperative beckons the reader to pause and consider the gravity of what Moses is about to say next: “STOP… THINK… CONTINUE: The blessing and the curse!”However, what Moses commands his people to see is not merely a conjuring of visual perspective. The Hebrew word ראה (re’eh) encompasses so much more than physical perception and the content that Moses presents after delivering the imperative demonstrates his desire for the nation to see beyond themselves and to what is visible from heaven’s perspective. The dynamic application of the word ראה is evident in its diverse uses throughout the Hebrew Bible. For instance, in Ecclesiastes 1:16 the author employs the word ראה to describe the seat of human intellect – the heart – having perceived and acquired great wisdom and knowledge:דברתי אני עם־לבי לאמר אני הנה הגדלתי והוספתי חכמה על כל־אשׁר־היה לפני על־ירושׁלם ולבי רָאָה הרבּה חכמה ודעת׃\n\nI said to myself: “Here I have grown richer and wiser than any that ruled before me over Jerusalem, and my mind has zealously absorbed (lit. seen - ra’ah) wisdom and learning.”\n\nElsewhere, in I Samuel 9:9, we discover that the prophets of Israel were formerly called “seers” – a participial noun of the same root, רואה (Ro’eh). Apparently, in the generations before the Davidic dynasty, the prophets of Israel carried a title that was symbolic of their ability to “see” Godly visions. Thus, Moses’ application of the word throughout the book in lieu of its accompanying context demands the people to enter the Promised Land with clarity and understanding of the big picture. The fifty-two commandments that follow throughout the Torah portion all pertain to life in the Land of Israel:These are the decrees and ordinances that you shall observe to perform in the Land that Hashem, the God of your forefathers, has given you, to possess it, all the days that you live on the Land (Deut. 12:1).To be successful in the Land of Israel, the Jewish people must perceive the nature of their collective calling and appreciate how each individual is integral to the prosperity or failure of the mission. Ibn Ezra, one of the most distinguished Jewish biblical commentators and philosophers of the Middle Ages, comments on re’eh (Deut. 11:26) and explains that Moses simultaneously speaks to each covenant member at the individual level. The imagery can be likened to a pew sitter who processes a public address from the pulpit while all the while sensing that the preacher’s eyes are directly on them. Moses is imparting to each Jew Godly vision, understanding, and wisdom to discern blessing from curse and to choose life!\n\nThe concept of personal salvation and a personal relationship with God is not original to Christianity. Rather, the concept is rooted in Judaism by what is called in Hebrew, Ge’ulah Pratit (personal redemption). In the rabbinic commentaries, personal redemption is discernible as a class from national or corporal redemption. However, the error in Western Christian thought is the tendency to divorce the individual from communal responsibility as it pertains to a person's influence on corporal standing. Both are important concepts in Jewish thought, and Judaism teaches that a multitude of personal redemptions is added together to bring about Israel’s corporeal redemption, and ultimately a global redemption. The order is not dissimilar to Paul’s numerous statements about the priority of the gospel message - to the Jew first and then to the Gentiles (Rom 1:16; 2:9-10). The consequence of this understanding is that our individual actions and the decisions we make affect the merit and standing of God’s covenant community. Often, the blessings and curses described in Moses’ discourse are interpreted by Bible readers to mean that personal prosperity and blessing will come to those who are faithful to God and obedient to Torah. While it is true that there is something to be said about personal merit and how it corresponds to individual standing in the Kingdom of Heaven (Mat. 5:19; 18:4; 19:28-20:16), the blessings and curses in Deuteronomy have to do with corporeal prosperity in this life, within the confines of time and space. It is no uncertainty that there are plenty of godly individuals who live paycheck to paycheck or struggle to make ends meet. There are numerous examples and parables in the New Testament of righteous individuals struggling in the present while accumulating riches in heaven e.g., the widow who gave two pennies out of her poverty (Mk. 12:41-44) and the illustration of Lazarus who was poor in this life but merited to be welcomed by Abraham in the Kingdom of Heaven (Luke 16:19-31).The perspective Moses is portraying pertains to national prosperity as an indicator of Israel’s success in fulfilling their covenant responsibility and achieving their national objective: Mainly, to promote righteousness and advance God-consciousness among the nations. Essentially, when the Jewish people are devout in their mission, personal redemptions are added together to accelerate the unveiling of the Master of the World and ultimately, global redemption. Thus, when Israel prospers, the world prospers. And when things are on the right track, one only needs to look to the Land of Israel and see – Blessing and prosperity among the Jewish people, rain upon the land, and abundance in the field. Yet, the message of Parshat Re’eh is that nobody should think for an instant, that they are insignificant as individuals in contributing to that vision! As Moses will explain in later chapters:\n\n“When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves thinking, ‘I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way,’ they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. (Deut. 29:19).’”\n\nThus, Parshat Re’eh is all about the opportunity that God extends to His people to receive His help and mercy so that they may elevate their collective neshamah (soul) to new heights. Re’eh is about seeing the whole of the Torah and its commandments from the proper perspective. It’s about seeing the mitzvoth with the same vision that was given to Moses with Israel coming into the Land and living according to the principles and guidelines of the Torah, which are enumerated collectively in this week’s parashah as follows:CH. 12 | Possessing the Land and eradicating idols. Establishing God’s Sanctuary in the place that He chooses to have His name dwell. CH. 13 | Responding properly to false prophets and demonstrating communal cohesion when there is a threat or disruption.CH. 14 | Contributing to the national and common welfare of the people and its leaders through the various tithes. In this way, the laborers who tend to the spiritual needs of the nation will be sustained, and when people come together to participate in the Divine Service, the Temple will be maintained and functioning. The motif is that every individual has something to offer to the community, whether talents, finances, or creativity, that contributes positively or negatively to the prosperity of the nation. Thus, every decision and action made on the part of the individual has the power to tilt the scales toward blessing or curse. As Moses puts it, for every covenant member, life and death come down to a choice.\n\nParshat Re’eh is all about seeing the program of God and buying into it. In the 21st century, we have the luxury of looking back over the course of nearly 4,000 years of Jewish history and perceiving the moments when our people lost the vision. Even in the moments of greatest despair, we also have the benefit of seeing that in our short-sightedness, God has never abandoned us, and the opportunity He offers to recapture the vision and return to Him remains in every generation.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Essentially, when the Jewish people are devout in their mission, personal redemptions are added together to accelerate the unveiling of the Master of the World and ultimately, global redemption. Thus, when Israel prospers, the world prospers. And when things are on the right track, one only needs to look to the Land of Israel and see – Blessing and prosperity among the Jewish people, rain upon the land, and abundance in the field. Yet, the message of <em>Parshat Re’eh </em>is that nobody should think for an instant, that they are insignificant as individuals in contributing to that vision! As Moses will explain in later chapters: </p><p><em>“When such a person hears the words of this oath and they invoke a blessing on themselves thinking, ‘I will be safe, even though I persist in going my own way,’ they will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry. (Deut. 29:19).’”</em></p><p>Thus, <em>Parshat Re’eh </em>is all about the opportunity that God extends to His people to receive His help and mercy so that they may elevate their collective <em>neshamah </em>(soul) to new heights. <em>Re’eh </em>is about seeing the whole of the Torah and its commandments from the proper perspective. It’s about seeing the mitzvoth with the same vision that was given to Moses with Israel coming into the Land and living according to the principles and guidelines of the Torah, which are enumerated collectively in this week’s parashah as follows:<br/><br/><strong>CH. 12 | </strong>Possessing the Land and eradicating idols. Establishing God’s Sanctuary in the place that He chooses to have His name dwell. <br/><br/><strong>CH. 13 | </strong>Responding properly to false prophets and demonstrating communal cohesion when there is a threat or disruption.<br/><br/><strong>CH. 14 |</strong> Contributing to the national and common welfare of the people and its leaders through the various tithes. In this way, the laborers who tend to the spiritual needs of the nation will be sustained, and when people come together to participate in the Divine Service, the Temple will be maintained and functioning. <br/><br/>The motif is that every individual has something to offer to the community, whether talents, finances, or creativity, that contributes positively or negatively to the prosperity of the nation. Thus, every decision and action made on the part of the individual has the power to tilt the scales toward blessing or curse. As Moses puts it, for every covenant member, life and death come down to a choice. </p><p><em>Parshat Re’eh </em>is all about seeing the program of God and buying into it. In the 21st century, we have the luxury of looking back over the course of nearly 4,000 years of Jewish history and perceiving the moments when our people lost the vision. Even in the moments of greatest despair, we also have the benefit of seeing that in our short-sightedness, God has never abandoned us, and the opportunity He offers to recapture the vision and return to Him remains in every generation. </p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nSh’lach-Lecha (“Send away”) is the 37th weekly Torah portion in the annual Jewish cycle of Torah reading and covers Numbers 13:1-15:41. The title is taken from the first word of the imperative that appears at the beginning of the parashah in verse 2 when God says to Moses: “Sh’lach-lecha” / Send away.”\n\n“And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the children of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.” — Numbers 13:1-2\n\nEvery so often, the content from the weekly Torah portion, as well as the liturgical contents of the synagogue service, not to mention the teachings of the New Testament intersect. Every Friday evening before sunset, synagogues conduct a special liturgical service to welcome the Sabbath called Kabbalat Shabbat, lit. the Welcoming of the Sabbath. The service is joyful and musical in nature, as the congregants progress through melodic renditions of Psalms 92-100 which begin with the introduction, “mizmor shir l’yom ha’Shabbat – A psalm, a song; for the Sabbath day” (Ps. 92:1).The service actually begins with Psalm 95 before making its way back around to chapter 92 by the end of the service. Psalms 95:1 encapsulates the grandeur of the evening: “Come, let us sing joyously to the LORD, raise a shout for the rock of our salvation!” The prayer continues, and although it is sung with adulation, it concludes with a warning and reminder of the suffering that ensued for Israel in the wilderness:\n\nIf only you would listen to God’s voice this day, and not become hard-hearted like the people at Merivah, like that time at Massah – in the desert, when your ancestors tried Me; and tested Me, though they had seen what I wrought.\n\nFor forty years I was troubled by that generation, and I said, “These are a people whose hearts have gone astray, they do not know My way,” so, in anger, I swore that they would not enter My rest. (Ps. 95:8-11)\n\nThe context of verses 10-11 is established in this week’s Torah portion, Parshat Sh’lach-Lecha. Numbers chapters 13-14 recount the story of the twelve spies who were sent by Moses to reconnoiter the Promised Land on behalf of the Israelites. According to the narrative, twelve of the truly great leaders of the nation, one from each tribe, went to survey the Land – and came back with a report that demoralized the people and caused them to lose faith in their ability to occupy their God-given inheritance. As a result, the entire generation was condemned to death in the Wilderness and Israel’s entry into the Land was delayed for almost forty years.\n\nIn synagogues around the world, as Jews gather to hear this story read publicly in the ceremonial reading of the Torah on Shabbat morning, they are also reminded of the harrowing consequences the incident of the Twelve Spies has played throughout Jewish history. According to Rabbinic tradition, the Israelite’s refusal to enter the Promised Land occurred on Tisha b’Av, a day on the biblical calendar that would later become the anniversary of the destruction of both the First and Second Temple, as well as later tragedies that would befall the Jewish community until the present day.In Psalm 95, the psalmist describes the people’s failure to enter the land metaphorically as their refusal to enter God’s “rest.” This description presents many questions, among them: What was Israel’s true destination in the Wilderness? And from where did the psalmist derive his parallel association of the Holy Land and rest?In Numbers 10:33, we read that at the start of their departure from Mount Sinai, the Ark of the LORD went before the people on a three-day journey to “seek for them a resting place.” When we read this passage in context, we find that perhaps the most incredible aspect of the wilderness journey was that God was already traveling ahead of the people seeking menucha (a resting place). The word menucha, “rest” more accurately means comfort. In fact, in Jewish tradition one of the names of the Messiah to come is Menachem, which means ‘comforter’ – ‘the provider of rest.’Psalm 95 describes the pinnacle of the journey from God’s perspective in the first person, “menuchati – My rest.” When we consider the narrative of the Twelve Spies in light of the journey’s beginning in Numbers 10, we begin to understand the people’s folly. The Hebrew word for searching is latur (to search/tour). Ironically, both the description of God going before the nation to find rest and the spies’ reconnaissance of the Promised Land are classified by the same word (Num. 10:33 to Num. 13:17). In essence, God was already “touring” ahead of the people to find the resting place so that He could gather and comfort His people quickly. Ultimately, the grievous sin in Parshat Shelach stems from a lack of faith i.e., trust in God. The people did not trust in the work that God had already done for them, and in determining to ‘latur’ for themselves, they became overwhelmed by what they saw with their own eyes (Num. 13:33).\n\nAt the beginning of Numbers 14, we read that the people lamented all that night over the spies’ report and plotted ways to subvert Moses and return to Egypt. Sadly, the next day when the people realized that they had made a mistake, they wanted to reenter the Promised Land and fight the Amalekites and the Canaanites. But it was too late. God did not go with them. And many Israelite men fell at the sword. Hence, in the parallel account of Psalm 95, the psalmist urges his audience, “hayom, im b’kolo tishma'u – Today, if you hear God’s voice...”.The dichotomy between these two parallel accounts is emphasized in the words ‘day’ and ‘night’. Just as the Torah says that the people cried all that night, they did so because they refused to hear the voice of God when He was present in the day. The details of this subtle contrast are not to be overlooked. In Jewish thought, day and night are prophetic illustrations of redemption and exile. Night represents the darkness Israel suffers in severance from God while day represents the light enjoyed by being in proximity to God’s countenance. When the story of the Twelve Spies is taken as the catalyst of Jewish exile – the forerunner of the many disasters that befell Israel on Tisha b’Av, the poetic contrast makes sense: The ultimate redemption that finally sees Israel and humanity reconciled to God can be described altogether as Day!In the New Testament, the writer of Hebrews makes an object lesson of this parallel and quotes the passage in Psalm 95 to expound on the lessons found in Parashat Shelach. In his rich midrashic interpretation, the apostle manages to tie all these elements together to illustrate the idea of God’s redemptive work through the theme of Shabbat:\n\nGod again set a certain day, calling it “Today.” This he did when a long time later he spoke through David, as in the passage already quoted:\n\n“Today, if you hear his voice,\n\ndo not harden your hearts.”\n\nFor if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken later about another day.\n\nThere remains [then] a Sabbath rest for God’s people; for anyone who enters God’s rest also rests from their works, just as God did from his. Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will perish by following their example of disobedience. (Hebrews 4:7-11)\n\nFor the sake of brevity, we have only included these verses to illustrate the topic. But please take the time to investigate the entirety of Hebrews chapters 3-4 for the full effect. For example, in Hebrews 3:12-19, the author admonishes his audience to avoid the sin of an unbelieving heart, referring to the generation that perished in the wilderness. Furthermore, he frequently quotes Psalm 95 directly as the source text for his argument and makes use of the psalm’s imagery in saying, “So long as it is called Today [hayom], encourage one another every day so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness (v. 13).” The apostle’s argument is masterful and brilliant and enunciates the fact that Shabbat is not merely a weekly occurrence, but a foretaste of something much greater.\n\nIn Hebrews chapter 3, The writer compares entering the Promised land to entering faith in Messiah. We could say that both Messiah and the entrance into the land came as the culmination of the covenant promises. Both Messiah and the entrance into the Promised Land require faith and obedience. Thus, the writer begins his discourse by pointing out that the first and most obvious lesson in Parshat Shelach is that falling short of God’s rest is the result of unbelief (Hebrews 3:19). Furthermore, the rest to which Hebrews refers to is the same rest described in Numbers 10 and Psalm 95. With that in mind, the author presents a profound observation of God’s work at creation:Now we who have believed enter that rest, just as God has declared, “So I declared on oath in my anger, ‘They shall never enter my rest.'”And yet his works have been finished since the creation of the world! (Hebrews 4:3)Just as Numbers 10 describes the Ark of God going before the nation to find a resting place, the writer of Hebrews describes God’s work as having been finished since the creation. This can be a puzzling statement if little thought is given, but it comes to life when we consider the source text forming the crux of his argument.When the psalmist alludes to God’s rest, there is only one ‘rest’ belonging to God mentioned in Scripture – His rest at Creation. Thus, the apostle recounts the Creation narrative and points out that according to the simple meaning of the text - the rest that the people were supposed to enter - really began on the first Sabbath after the six days of God creating the Universe; and since God did not resume creating after His rest on the eighth day, His eternal Shabbat is still waiting for all those who choose to listen to His voice, so long as it is called ‘today.’In a similar vein, the Prophet Isaiah says:\n\n“Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near: Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon\". (Isa. 55:6-7)\n\nThis Friday evening, as our people sing the words of Psalm 95 in synagogues around the world, let us also join them in considering the lessons of this week’s Torah portion, determining to remove the barriers in our own hearts that prevent us from truly and fully entering God’s comfort.Shabbat Shalom\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nJoin us for this week’s reading of Parashat Vayechi as we take a deeper look into the last verses in the book of Genesis (47:28-50:26). The other passages included in this week’s reading are 1 Kings 2:1-2:12, Hebrews 11:21-22, and 1 Peter 1:3-9.Throughout the book of Genesis, we learn about our fathers, their interesting lives, their wives and children, and their process of passing on blessings from generation to generation. We also learn that our ancestors are mere mortals, and yet they were chosen by God to be eternal legacies that impact future generations. Our ancestors have paved the way for faith in God and in showing us how to walk in step with Him.\n\nIn these last few chapters of the book of Genesis, we will discover more about the end of Jacob's life in the land of Egypt and the way he blessed each of his children and grandchildren. Here are the instructions and blessings he gave:\n\nThe first instruction that Jacob gave to Joseph was: “When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, ‘If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.” (Gen. 47:29-30). At this point, Jacob was 147 years old, and together with his sons and their families, they were living in Egypt with Joseph for 17 years. Joseph was the second-most powerful man in the Egyptian kingdom, and yet he agreed to his father’s request and brought his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to see their grandfather before he died.\n\n“Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. Israel said to Joseph, ‘I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.’” —Genesis 48:10-11\n\nPicture Jacob lying in his bed about to die with all twelve of his sons by his bedside. Each of the sons was probably eager to hear what blessing they would receive from their father. Jacob blesses all twelve of his sons and then gives one last instruction for him to be buried in the cave in the field of Machpelah where Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, and Leah were buried.\n\nWhen Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.” —Genesis 49:33\n\nAs soon as Jacob breathes his last breath, Joseph throws himself on his father weeping over him and kissing him. He has his father embalmed and then asks Pharaoh for permission to bury his father in Canaan. With the blessing of Pharaoh, Joseph went to Canaan to bury his father, accompanied by Pharaoh’s officials and Joseph’s family. Joseph and his brothers fulfilled their promise to their father by burying him in the cave in the field of Machpelah. As Joseph and the whole company return to Egypt, Joseph’s brothers are filled with fear that Joseph will try to pay them back for all the wrongs they did to him. Therefore, they lie to him and tell him that their father left one last instruction for Joseph to forgive his brothers. As Joseph sees his brothers, he graciously explains to them, “‘Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God? You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.’ And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.” (Gen. 19-21)Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years, embalmed and placed in a coffin kept in Egypt.\n\nCan you see a similarity between the life of Joseph and the life of Yeshua? They were both hated by their brothers, sold, suffered greatly, and yet became powerful men who saved many lives. Joseph provided food for the hungry and saved many lives. Yeshua fed millions, not only physical food but also spiritual food. Yeshua gave up his life to save all who would believe in him. Joseph was hidden from his brothers and they did not recognize him when they came to Egypt. Yet, Joseph knew his brothers right away, had compassion and love towards them, and even chose to forgive them for betraying him. Yeshua is hidden from the eyes of his people and betrayed by many, and yet he knows his people, loves them, forgives them, and gave up his life for them.\n\nAs we reflect on Joseph’s life, we see the long-suffering he had to endure. He stood up before his family and expressed his interpretation of his dreams, and because of this his brothers hated him, were jealous of him, and even collaborated against him.

      "content_html": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\" style=\"color:white\">Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War</p><p>Join us for this week’s reading of Parashat Vayechi as we take a deeper look into the last verses in the book of Genesis (47:28-50:26). The other passages included in this week’s reading are 1 Kings 2:1-2:12, Hebrews 11:21-22, and 1 Peter 1:3-9.<br/><br/>Throughout the book of Genesis, we learn about our fathers, their interesting lives, their wives and children, and their process of passing on blessings from generation to generation. We also learn that our ancestors are mere mortals, and yet they were chosen by God to be eternal legacies that impact future generations. Our ancestors have paved the way for faith in God and in showing us how to walk in step with Him. <br/><br/></p><p>In these last few chapters of the book of Genesis, we will discover more about the end of Jacob's life in the land of Egypt and the way he blessed each of his children and grandchildren. Here are the instructions and blessings he gave:<br/></p><p>The first instruction that Jacob gave to Joseph was: <em>“When the time drew near for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and said to him, ‘If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness. Do not bury me in Egypt, but when I rest with my fathers, carry me out of Egypt and bury me where they are buried.” </em>(Gen. 47:29-30)<em>.</em> At this point, Jacob was 147 years old, and together with his sons and their families, they were living in Egypt with Joseph for 17 years. Joseph was the second-most powerful man in the Egyptian kingdom, and yet he agreed to his father’s request and brought his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, to see their grandfather before he died.<br/><br/></p><p><em>“Now Israel’s eyes were failing because of old age, and he could hardly see. So Joseph brought his sons close to him, and his father kissed them and embraced them. Israel said to Joseph, ‘I never expected to see your face again, and now God has allowed me to see your children too.’” —Genesis 48:10-11</em></p><p>Picture Jacob lying in his bed about to die with all twelve of his sons by his bedside. Each of the sons was probably eager to hear what blessing they would receive from their father. Jacob blesses all twelve of his sons and then gives one last instruction for him to be buried in the cave in the field of Machpelah where Abraham, Sarah, Isaac, Rebekah, and Leah were buried.<br/><br/></p><p><em>When Jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons, he drew his feet up into the bed, breathed his last and was gathered to his people.” —Genesis 49:33</em></p><p>As soon as Jacob breathes his last breath, Joseph throws himself on his father weeping over him and kissing him. He has his father embalmed and then asks Pharaoh for permission to bury his father in Canaan. With the blessing of Pharaoh, Joseph went to Canaan to bury his father, accompanied by Pharaoh’s officials and Joseph’s family. Joseph and his brothers fulfilled their promise to their father by burying him in the cave in the field of Machpelah. <br/><br/>As Joseph and the whole company return to Egypt, Joseph’s brothers are filled with fear that Joseph will try to pay them back for all the wrongs they did to him. Therefore, they lie to him and tell him that their father left one last instruction for Joseph to forgive his brothers. As Joseph sees his brothers, he graciously explains to them, <em>“‘Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God? You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives. So then, don’t be afraid. I will provide for you and your children.’ And he reassured them and spoke kindly to them.”</em> (Gen. 19-21)<br/><br/>Joseph died at the age of one hundred and ten years, embalmed and placed in a coffin kept in Egypt.<br/><br/></p><p>Can you see a similarity between the life of Joseph and the life of Yeshua? They were both hated by their brothers, sold, suffered greatly, and yet became powerful men who saved many lives. Joseph provided food for the hungry and saved many lives. Yeshua fed millions, not only physical food but also spiritual food. Yeshua gave up his life to save all who would believe in him. Joseph was hidden from his brothers and they did not recognize him when they came to Egypt. Yet, Joseph knew his brothers right away, had compassion and love towards them, and even chose to forgive them for betraying him. Yeshua is hidden from the eyes of his people and betrayed by many, and yet he knows his people, loves them, forgives them, and gave up his life for them. <br/><br/><br/></p><p>As we reflect on Joseph’s life, we see the long-suffering he had to endure. He stood up before his family and expressed his interpretation of his dreams, and because of this his brothers hated him, were jealous of him, and even collaborated against him. All the hate was simply because he stood up and told them the simple truth, which may have caused them to feel that Joseph was being arrogant. How would one feel if we were in his position?  Lonely, angry, upset, ashamed, embarrassed, or maybe blaming himself? His brothers threw him into a pit to let him die, then sold him to the Egyptians. Later, he was put in prison for 12 years.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nShalom dear friends,Today, we embark on an exciting journey as we dive into Parashat Vayikra, found in Leviticus 1:1-5:25, which explores the deep relationship between God's love, His holiness, and the significance of the sacrificial system. As we uncover these profound truths, may our hearts be captivated by the depths of God's love and the grace He offers through the atonement for sin.\n\nAs we begin our study, it's crucial to understand the primary purpose of the sacrifices detailed in Leviticus: to reconcile sinful humanity with our holy God. The sacrificial system provided the people of Israel a way to atone for their sins, restoring their relationship with God, and emphasizing the severity of sin and the necessity of forgiveness.\n\n“Now the Lord called to Moses, and spoke to him from the tabernacle of meeting, saying, “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them: ‘When any one of you brings an offering to the Lord, you shall bring your offering of the livestock — of the herd and of the flock. ‘If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the Lord. Then he shall put his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on his behalf to make atonement for him.“ — Leviticus 1:1-4\n\nCentral to the sacrificial system was the high priest, who mediated between God and the people. The high priest presented the sacrifices on behalf of the people and played a crucial role in maintaining their relationship with God.\n\nBurnt Offering (Olah): The Ascending Offering (Lev. 1:3-4)The burnt offering, also known as the Olah, was a voluntary sacrifice given to the Lord to express dedication and devotion. The offering's entirety was consumed by fire on the altar, symbolizing the complete surrender of oneself to God.Grain Offering (Minchah): The Meal Offering (Lev. 2)The grain offering was a way for the Israelites to express gratitude to God for His provision. This offering consisted of finely ground flour, oil, and frankincense, which were combined and burnt on the altar as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.Peace Offering (Shelamim): The Fellowship Offering (Lev. 3)The peace offering, or Shelamim, served to express gratitude and request God's favor. The sacrificial animal was shared among the worshiper, the priests, and God, symbolizing the communal fellowship between the people and their Creator.Sin Offering (Chatat): Restoring Relationships (Lev. 4:27-28)The sin offering, or Chatat, was a mandatory sacrifice given to atone for unintentional sins committed against God or others. This offering emphasized the need for purification and the importance of maintaining the right relationship with God and fellow human beings.Guilt Offering (Asham): Making AmendsThe guilt offering, or Asham, was presented when a person committed a breach of trust or desecrated sacred things. This offering demonstrated the necessity of making amends and the seriousness with which God regards sin.\n\nAt the core of the sacrificial system was God's unwavering love for His people. He established these rituals not to burden them, but to provide a means for His chosen people to draw near to Him and experience His grace.Throughout the descriptions of the various offerings, the phrase \"sweet aroma\" often appears. This expression signifies God's pleasure in receiving the sacrifices, as they demonstrated the people's repentance and desire to maintain a right relationship with Him.\n\n\"But he shall wash its entrails and its legs with water. And the priest shall burn all on the altar as a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, a sweet aroma to the Lord. – Leviticus 1:9\n\nThe sacrificial system foreshadowed the ultimate sacrifice that would be made on behalf of the people: the atoning death of Yeshua, the Lamb of God. Through His sacrifice, Yeshua provided a perfect and lasting atonement for the sins of the world, fulfilling the sacrificial system.\n\nFor surely it is not angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants. For this reason he had to be made like them, fully human in every way, in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God, and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people. — Hebrews 2:16-17\n\nYeshua's death on the cross was the final, perfect sacrifice. He offered Himself willingly and without blemish, fulfilling the requirements of the Old Testament sacrificial system. Through His selfless act, we receive forgiveness, reconciliation, and eternal life.\n\n\"He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world.\" – 1 John 2:2\n\nYeshua also serves as our eternal High Priest, interceding on our behalf before the Father (Hebrews 7:24-25). His priesthood surpasses that of the Levitical order, providing us with constant access to God's presence and grace.\n\nThe sacrificial system was established in response to the holiness of God. As the Creator, God is inherently holy, and His nature requires that sin be addressed and atoned for.Because of His holiness, God cannot overlook sin. The sacrificial system provided a way for the Israelites to receive forgiveness and maintain a relationship with their holy God.Sin separates us from God, creating a barrier that only atonement can remove. The sacrificial system revealed the gravity of sin and the importance of reconciliation with our Creator.\n\nAs believers in Yeshua, we receive the benefits of His atoning sacrifice, experiencing God's grace, mercy, and forgiveness. We are no longer bound by the sacrificial system, but instead, we have direct access to the Father through the blood of Yeshua.Although Yeshua's sacrifice has brought us into a right relationship with God, we are still called to pursue holiness in our daily lives. This process, known as sanctification, is an ongoing journey of growth and transformation as we become more like Yeshua.The sacrificial system and Yeshua's atonement exemplify God's love for His people. As followers of Yeshua, we are called to love others sacrificially, reflecting the love of our Savior in our relationships and actions.\n\nAs we have explored Parashat Vayikra and the sacrificial system, we can see the beauty and depth of God's love and holiness. Through the sacrifices and Yeshua's ultimate atonement, we are drawn into a closer relationship with our Creator, experiencing His grace and forgiveness.As we embrace the atonement journey, let us be ever mindful of the great love that God has for us, and the incredible sacrifice that Yeshua made on our behalf. May our hearts be filled with gratitude, and our lives be marked by the pursuit of holiness and love for others.\n\nIn modern times, it is essential for believers to appreciate and understand the significance of Yeshua's atoning sacrifice. This understanding deepens our faith and helps us to grasp the magnitude of God's love for us.As followers of Yeshua, we have the responsibility and privilege of sharing the message of atonement with others. This includes not only explaining the theological aspects but also demonstrating the transformative power of Yeshua's sacrifice in our own lives.The concept of atonement can also be applied to the broader context of social justice. As believers, we are called to work toward reconciliation and healing in a world marred by sin and brokenness.\n\nThe Bible teaches that Yeshua will one day return to earth, bringing about the final fulfillment of atonement. This event will usher in a new era of peace and harmony, where sin and its effects will be eradicated.Ultimately, the culmination of atonement will lead to the creation of a new heaven and a new earth, where God's presence will be fully realized, and His people will live in perfect harmony with Him.The promise of Yeshua's return and the establishment of a new heaven and earth provide believers with eternal hope. This hope sustains us through the challenges and trials of this life, as we look forward to the day when we will experience the fullness of God's love and the completion of the atonement process.\n\nIn response to this incredible love, let us strive to live lives that honor and glorify God, as we seek to grow in holiness and share the message of atonement with a world in need of healing and reconciliation.

      "title": "Parshat Terumah: Is My Body a Temple?",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe 19th reading from the Torah is named Terumah which is translated as “contribution” or “gifts.” It is found in Exodus 25:1-27:19. The first contribution recorded in the Torah is the terumah given by the people of Israel for the building of the Mishkan (Tabernacle). The Mishkan, which later gave way to the Temple in Jerusalem, was the resting place for God’s Presence and was the central focus of Israel’s corporeal relationship with God. Three times a year, the Jewish men were commanded to ascend to Jerusalem for the three pilgrim festivals of Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot (Deut. 16:16-17); and in the days of Yeshua, the population of Jerusalem would swell to six times its normal size during these special times! Even today, no other location is more sacred and central in Jewish life than the place where the Temple once stood. And perhaps no other subject in the Bible teaches more about the process of drawing near to God, the substance of prayer, and the atoning work of our Messiah than the Holy Sanctuary.\n\nWith the exception of the tragic incident of the Golden Calf (chapters 32-33), the rest of the Book of Exodus is devoted to the preparations for and the construction of the Tabernacle. However, many Jewish commentators agree that the incident of the Golden Calf is not unrelated to the Tabernacle. In fact, the medieval Italian Rabbi, Obadiah Sforno (d. 1550), taught that the very construction of the Tabernacle was made necessary only because of the sin of the Golden Calf (Ex. 20:21, 25:9, 31:18). Harkening back to the Mount Sinai experience, he explains that the entire nation achieved such a level of prophecy that at that time, every Jew was worthy of housing the Divine Presence. But after the sin of the Golden Calf, Israel fell from their high level of spirituality, and it became necessary for Israel to host a “central” Sanctuary.Sforno’s evaluation of the Israelite community’s status prior to the sin of the Golden Calf is similar to the New Testament teaching that each of us should be a “human sanctuary” of the Holy Spirit: “Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies” (1 Cor. 6:19-20). According to the model of the Tabernacle introduced in Parshat Terumah and the teachings of the apostles, our personal temples contribute to a corporal sanctuary of God’s people (Eph. 2:19-22).\n\nIn Exodus 25:2, God invites the entire nation of Israel to voluntarily contribute from their wealth and talents for the construction of the holy sanctuary (Ex. 25:2). Later in Exodus 36:3-6, the Torah states that the people were so anxious to have a share in creating a sacred space for God’s dwelling that those in charge of the work had to appeal to Moses to stop the people from giving! In response to the heartfelt and overwhelming efforts of the people (36:5), God stated his intended purpose: “They shall make a sanctuary for me – so that I may dwell among them” (25:8). Interestingly, the Hebrew does not say “among them” as most translations imply, but it says, ve’shachanti betocham, literally, ‘And I shall dwell within them.’ The implication is that God did not simply want to dwell in an inanimate edifice but within the hearts of the Jewish people.Judaism has long taught that in the absence of the Holy Temple, there is always a sanctuary of sorts in our midst: “Every Jew should be a human temple. If he is holy, his personal temple is holy; if he sins, he contaminates it” (Scherman & Zlotowitz 1993, 569). In that regard, we recognize that every aspect of human life has the potential to be elevated and infused with holiness. In the days of the Temple, most of the offerings were served as food for the priests performing the services and the individuals drawing near for worship (1 Cor. 9:13). In the absence of the altar today, the Talmud teaches that a man’s table makes atonement (Hagigah 27a). That is to say that the center of our conversations, our sustenance, and daily behavior represent personal offerings of devotion and thanksgiving. In the same manner, the Apostle Paul wrote: “Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (1 Cor. 10:31). He also wrote concerning the redemption that has been procured for us by the atoning death of Yeshua: “You were bought at a price; therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s” (1 Cor. 6:20).\n\nIn the book of Ezekiel, the prophet warned Israel concerning the consequences of spiritual apathy, idolatry, and injustice: “Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary?” (Ez. 8:6). Ezekiel spoke to a generation convinced that the Temple’s holiness, the habitat of God’s presence, would protect them from destruction and exile. However, Ezekiel stressed that the Divine Presence was gradually receding from the Temple. As we learn in Exodus 25-40, the Temple’s holiness was conditioned to the hearts of the people; when they lost their merit, it lost its holiness. Soon, the Temple would no longer be a temple, but merely a grand edifice, a shell devoid of sanctity. In this regard, Paul reminds all believers: “Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst?” (1 Cor. 3:16).

      "content_html": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\" style=\"color:white\">Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War</p><p>The 19th reading from the Torah is named <em>Terumah </em>which is translated as “contribution” or “gifts.” It is found in Exodus 25:1-27:19. The first contribution recorded in the Torah is the <em>terumah </em>given by the people of Israel for the building of the <em>Mishkan</em> (Tabernacle). The Mishkan, which later gave way to the Temple in Jerusalem, was the resting place for God’s Presence and was the central focus of Israel’s corporeal relationship with God. Three times a year, the Jewish men were commanded to ascend to Jerusalem for the three pilgrim festivals of Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot (Deut. 16:16-17); and in the days of Yeshua, the population of Jerusalem would swell to six times its normal size during these special times! Even today, no other location is more sacred and central in Jewish life than the place where the Temple once stood. And perhaps no other subject in the Bible teaches more about the process of drawing near to God, the substance of prayer, and the atoning work of our Messiah than the Holy Sanctuary. <br/><br/></p><p>With the exception of the tragic incident of the Golden Calf (chapters 32-33), the rest of the Book of Exodus is devoted to the preparations for and the construction of the Tabernacle. However, many Jewish commentators agree that the incident of the Golden Calf is not unrelated to the Tabernacle. In fact, the medieval Italian Rabbi, Obadiah Sforno (d. 1550), taught that the very construction of the Tabernacle was made necessary only because of the sin of the Golden Calf (Ex. 20:21, 25:9, 31:18). Harkening back to the Mount Sinai experience, he explains that the entire nation achieved such a level of prophecy that at that time, every Jew was worthy of housing the Divine Presence. But after the sin of the Golden Calf, Israel fell from their high level of spirituality, and it became necessary for Israel to host a “central” Sanctuary.<br/><br/>Sforno’s evaluation of the Israelite community’s status prior to the sin of the Golden Calf is similar to the New Testament teaching that each of us should be a “human sanctuary” of the Holy Spirit: “<em>Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your bodies”</em> (1 Cor. 6:19-20). According to the model of the Tabernacle introduced in <em>Parshat Terumah</em> and the teachings of the apostles, our personal temples contribute to a corporal sanctuary of God’s people (Eph. 2:19-22). <br/><br/></p><p>In Exodus 25:2, God invites the entire nation of Israel to voluntarily contribute from their wealth and talents for the construction of the holy sanctuary (Ex. 25:2). Later in Exodus 36:3-6, the Torah states that the people were so anxious to have a share in creating a sacred space for God’s dwelling that those in charge of the work had to appeal to Moses to stop the people from giving! In response to the heartfelt and overwhelming efforts of the people (36:5), God stated his intended purpose: “<em>They shall make a sanctuary for me – so that I may dwell among them” </em>(25:8). Interestingly, the Hebrew does not say “among them” as most translations imply, but it says, <em>ve’shachanti betocham</em>, literally, ‘And I shall dwell within them.’ The implication is that God did not simply want to dwell in an inanimate edifice but within the hearts of the Jewish people.<br/><br/>Judaism has long taught that in the absence of the Holy Temple, there is always a sanctuary of sorts in our midst: “Every Jew should be a human temple. If he is holy, his personal temple is holy; if he sins, he contaminates it” (Scherman &amp; Zlotowitz 1993, 569). In that regard, we recognize that every aspect of human life has the potential to be elevated and infused with holiness. In the days of the Temple, most of the offerings were served as food for the priests performing the services and the individuals drawing near for worship (1 Cor. 9:13). In the absence of the altar today, the Talmud teaches that a man’s table makes atonement (Hagigah 27a). That is to say that the center of our conversations, our sustenance, and daily behavior represent personal offerings of devotion and thanksgiving. In the same manner, the Apostle Paul wrote: “<em>Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God”</em> (1 Cor. 10:31). He also wrote concerning the redemption that has been procured for us by the atoning death of Yeshua: “<em>You were bought at a price; therefore, glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s</em>” (1 Cor. 6:20).<br/><br/></p><p>In the book of Ezekiel, the prophet warned Israel concerning the consequences of spiritual apathy, idolatry, and injustice: “<em>Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, to make Me go far away from My sanctuary?</em>” (Ez. 8:6). Ezekiel spoke to a generation convinced that the Temple’s holiness, the habitat of God’s presence, would protect them from destruction and exile. However, Ezekiel stressed that the Divine Presence was gradually receding from the Temple. As we learn in Exodus 25-40, the Temple’s holiness was conditioned to the hearts of the people; when they lost their merit, it lost its holiness. Soon, the Temple would no longer be a temple, but merely a grand edifice, a shell devoid of sanctity. In this regard, Paul reminds all believers: “<em>Don't you know that you yourselves are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in your midst?</em>” (1 Cor. 3:16). The question of whether we are temples is self-evident. The real question is, are we offering our bodies and livelihood as a living sacrifice, holy, and accepting to God? This, after all, is our reasonable service (Rm. 12:1-2).</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThis year, Passover falls on the eve of March 27th. It is the one Old Testament feast that perhaps most particularly points to Yeshua. This is the feast of Redemption and we celebrate it for 7 days. Yeshua is our redemption. He redeemed us out of a life of bondage to sin and brought us into freedom in Him. It was also the evening of Passover that Yeshua had His last supper, the Passover Seder, with His disciples and that was the night He was betrayed.\n\nWhen the hour had come, He sat down, and the twelve apostles with Him. Then He said to them, “With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” - Luke 22:14 – 16\n\nOn the very first Passover, God commanded the children of Israel:\n\n“This day is to be a memorial for you. You are to keep it as a feast to Adonai. Throughout your generations you are to keep it as an eternal ordinance. For seven days you are to eat matzot, but on the first day you must remove hametz from your houses...” - Exodus 12:14-15a\n\nAs Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians, marching after them. They were terrified and cried out to the Lord...\n\nMoses answered the people, “Do not be afraid. Stand firm and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today. The Egyptians you see today you will never see again. The Lord will fight for you; you need only to be still.” - Exodus 14:10, 13 – 14\n\nOn the morning of Passover eve, all the leavened food items are burned in a ceremony called “Bi’ur Chametz.” Leavened food (chametz) is considered a corrupting influence—a hidden uncleanness that manipulates purer elements and sin. Spiritual leaven is like an evil impulse within us that corrupts and sours our soul. We must put it away from us and sanctify ourselves.\n\nGet rid of the old chametz, so you may be a new batch, just as you are unleavened—for Messiah, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us celebrate the feast not with old chametz, the chametz of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened bread—the matzah of sincerity and truth. - 1 Cor. 5:7-8\n\nThe Seder is the centerpiece of any Passover experience. A Seder is a festive meal that takes place on the first night of the holiday. Family and friends join together to celebrate. The word Seder means “order,” and the Passover seder has 15 separate steps in its traditional order. During the Seder, we read the Passover Haggadah, which guides us through those steps.\n\n1. Kadeish: Sanctification\n\nA blessing is recited over wine in honor of the holiday. When the seder falls on a Friday night, this version of the Kiddush is recited for Passover and Shabbat. When the seder falls on a Saturday night, as it does this year, we continue with a special version of Havdalah. The wine is then drunk. A second cup is then poured (but not yet drunk).\n\n2. Ur'chatz: Washing\n\nParticipants wash their hands without a blessing in preparation for eating the Karpas.\n\n3. Karpas: Vegetable\n\nA vegetable (usually parsley) is dipped in saltwater and eaten to remind us of the tears that the people of Israel shed when they were slaves in Egypt.\n\n4. Yachatz: Breaking\n\nThe middle of the three matzot on the table is broken into two pieces. The smaller part is returned to the pile, the larger one is set aside for the afikoman, wrapped in a cloth napkin, and hidden until later in the Seder (see below).\n\n5. Magid: The Story\n\nA retelling of the story of the Exodus from Egypt and the first Pesach. This begins with the youngest person asking The Four Questions, a set of questions about the proceedings designed to encourage participation in the seder.\n\n6. Rachtzah: Washing\n\nParticipants wash their hands again, this time with a blessing, in preparation for eating the matzah.\n\n7. Motzi: Blessing over Grain Products\n\nHaMotzi is the blessing over the bread at the beginning of the meal. Since it's Passover, this blessing is recited over the matzah.\n\n8. Matzah: Blessing over Matzah\n\nA blessing specific to matzah is recited, and a bit of matzah is eaten.\n\n9. Maror: Bitter Herbs\n\nA blessing is recited over a bitter vegetable (usually raw horseradish mixed with grated beets; sometimes romaine lettuce), and it is eaten. This is a reminder of the bitterness of life as slaves.\n\n10. Koreich: The Sandwich\n\nThe maror that fills the koreich sandwich is dipped into Charoset, a paste made of dates, nuts, and wine—whose consistency is reminiscent of the clay our ancestors used in Egypt to manufacture bricks.\n\n11. Shulchan Oreich: Dinner\n\nA festive meal is eaten. There is no particular requirement regarding what to eat at this meal (except, of course, that chametz cannot be eaten). Often, the meal begins by eating a hard-boiled egg, which is a symbol of mourning, in remembrance of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\n12. Tzafun: The Afikoman\n\nThe piece of matzah set aside earlier is eaten as “dessert,” the last food of the meal. Different families have different traditions relating to the afikoman. Most commonly, the adults hide it and the children have to look for it. The child who finds it gets a prize or monetary gift. Some families have the children hide it, while the parents have to either find it or ransom it back.\n\n13. Barech: Grace after Meals\n\nThe third and fourth cups of wine are poured, and Birkat HaMazon (Grace) is recited.\n\n14. Hallel: Praises\n\nThe standard group of psalms that make up a full Hallel is recited at this point. A blessing is recited over the last cup of wine and it is drunk.\n\n15. Nirtzah: Closing\n\nA simple statement that the seder has been completed, with a wish that next year, we may celebrate Pesach in Jerusalem (i.e., that the Messiah will come within the next year). The closing may be followed by various traditional songs, hymns, and stories. Friends, in these unprecedented times, let us remember that nothing we face is too big for God. While we celebrate this Passover, and soon the resurrection of our Lord, let us throw out the old leaven of doubt and fear—and replace it with the “new lump” of joyful faith in God.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nEvery summer, our Vision for Israel team works vigorously to distribute school bags to children from distressed families throughout the country, and from all sectors and communities—religious and secular, Arab and Ethiopian, new immigrants, victims of terrorism, at-risk children, asylum seekers, migrant workers, and more.\n\nThe goal has been to reach every needy child we can and to make sure they start the new school year as equals among their classmates—able to concentrate on their studies and succeed.\n\nAt the distributions, our team met families who were suffering from very difficult financial situations—parents unable to support their children due to disability, single-parent families in which the father refuses to pay alimony, and some with many children who are supported only by Social Security.\n\nOne family, in particular, touched our hearts at the distribution—a single mother, doing everything she can to support her son throughout the many difficulties they have in life.\n\nTheir son Gabriel* was included in the \"Babysitter\" program a few months after he was born, so that she could continue to work. Gabriel, who did not speak at all until the age of three, was diagnosed with autism, following a lengthy series of tests.\n\nIn January 2017, the father unexpectedly left home, taking the family savings with him. His departure was devastating for Gabriel's emotional state, not to mention the mother's.\n\nBut despite the enormous difficulty, she persevered—continuing to take care of Gabriel's special needs, and his integration into an appropriate educational setting.\n\nMore hardship struck as she was later fired from her job, and became recognized as a victim of human trafficking—she had been abducted and tortured in Sinai after fleeing her country.\n\nShe has since found a new job and is managing to keep her head above the water for the sake of her beloved son and his special needs.\n\nAnd thanks to the care of his mother, with the help of a social worker, Gabriel now studies in kindergarten—where he is making solid progress. He functions better and is very much loved by the other children and the staff.\n\nThis is one of the countless stories we hear each time we have a distribution—and one of the reasons why this project is so special to us.\n\nThe ability to give these children a chance to start the school year with a schoolbag and study equipment, just like everyone else, gives us great satisfaction—and it’s heartwarming to see the children's eyes glistening with joy, and their parents' enthusiasm for the quality and variety of the schoolbags.\n\nThe light in their eyes is indeed the fuel that motivates us to continue working—with the help of our generous donors—for all the needy in Israel.*Name has been changed\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

This Impact Report is a glimpse into what faith in action looks like: ordinary lives transformed by extraordinary compassion. Through every challenge, your prayers and support have made a difference. As you read, we hope you’re reminded that light still shines in the darkness—and that together, we are part of something eternal.\n\nThis summer, Vision for Israel distributed 912 high-quality schoolbags to first graders across Israel through our Pack to School initiative. Working with local municipalities and welfare offices, we identified families of low socioeconomic status and coordinated respectful, dignified distributions. Each child received a sturdy backpack with a protective back shield and a matching kit: pencil case, water bottle, and lunch box. The designs delighted the kids, helping build excitement for the first day of school. Distributions spanned cities in central and southern Israel. Beyond supplies, the project affirmed to each family that they are seen and supported. By equipping children with the tools they need—both practical and emotional—we’re helping them begin their educational journey with confidence, belonging, and joy.\n\nIn August, we hosted a special evening at the Millennium Center for reservists’ families—about 190 participants, including 80 children entering first grade. Families traveled from near and far to share a generous dinner, fellowship, and a night of wonder. Kids enjoyed juggling, archery workshops, a VR and multimedia zone, and a comic circus show that filled the room with laughter. Each child received a premium schoolbag and kit (pencil case, water bottle, and lunch box), ensuring they start school prepared and proud. The event, held in cooperation with the brigade team, offered more than fun and gifts. It created a space to honor the sacrifice of reservists and the resilience of their children—young heroes waiting patiently for their father’s safe return. Parents expressed heartfelt thanks, sharing how the evening strengthened their families and renewed hope. Smiles, full hearts, and equipped students were the greatest reward.\n\nOur annual scholarship ceremony took on deeper meaning this year as approximately 80% of recipients are survivors of the October 7, 2023, attacks. We met young men and women whose lives changed in an instant—students determined to continue their studies despite profound emotional and financial challenges. The evening included refreshments, warm greetings, and a captivating lecture by a Guinness World Record holder in memory techniques, offering practical tools for learning and focus. The heart of the event was the awarding of scholarships and the moving testimonies from recipients—stories of grief, courage, perseverance, and the hope of a renewed future. Scholarships help cover tuition and educational costs, but they also communicate something more: you are not alone. Vision for Israel remains committed to standing with terror survivors—providing both tangible support and community—so they can reclaim their dreams, rebuild stability, and move forward with dignity into a new season of life.\n\nAt the Millennium Center, we dedicated a new-generation Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU) ambulance to Magen David Adom—specially designed for multi-casualty events and equipped with two treatment beds. This is the first ambulance donated to MDA in the new Jewish year and the 16th ambulance Vision for Israel has donated over the years—another milestone in our 31 years of strengthening national resilience. Senior MDA leaders, officials from the Modi’in Municipality, and community guests joined the ceremony. Barry and Batya emphasized VFI’s unwavering commitment to saving lives and supporting Israel’s emergency infrastructure. This advanced vehicle significantly enhances rapid response and coordinated care in complex incidents, helping first responders stabilize multiple patients simultaneously. We see this as a sacred trust: to invest in readiness before crisis strikes. Through continued partnership with MDA, we’re building capacity that protects communities, shortens response times, and gives every Israeli a greater chance when seconds matter most.\n\nAs Israel prepared for Rosh Hashanah—a season of renewal and family gatherings—our team distributed over 1,200 gift cards to households facing financial hardship. Holiday meals can be an overwhelming burden for single-parent families, people with physical or mental disabilities, the sick, elderly, and others in need. We partnered with local authorities and community leaders across the country to ensure support reached the right families in time. The gift cards preserve dignity by allowing recipients to choose their own holiday essentials—fresh produce, proteins, and festive items—so they can celebrate with joy. Many expressed heartfelt thanks for the personal care, saying the help arrived just when it was most needed. Together, we transformed worry into welcome, filling hearts and homes with hope.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nAs the holiday of Purim approaches, all of us can relate to how the Jewish people must have felt during the time of Esther in the Bible. Haman and many others had planned to destroy the Jewish people, and this is exactly what Hamas, Hezbollah, and all the enemies of Israel want to do to the nation of Israel. And yet in the book of Esther, God had a sovereign plan to deliver His people and make a way for the Jewish people to fight and defeat our enemies. Today, all of us living in Israel and those praying around the world, are pressing into the Lord to see Him do it again. We pray, “Lord, come fight for your people, protect and shield them from the enemy, and deliver Israel and the Jewish people again!”As the Jewish people celebrate Purim this month, on the 14th of Adar, we remember the story of God delivering the Jewish people from imminent destruction in the ancient Persian Empire. This holiday is named after the word \"pur\" (lots), for the lots cast by Haman who was the prime minister under King Ahasuerus (Xerxes I), to determine the day he would exterminate the Jews. This story, encapsulated in Megillat Esther (Book of Esther), showcases themes of courage, faith, and God’s divine orchestration.\n\nThe Purim narrative highlights Esther, a Jewish girl who becomes queen and conceals her Jewish identity. Her cousin Mordecai refuses to bow down to Haman, which incites Haman's wrath. Haman persuades the king to sign an edict to annihilate the Jews. The story unfolds as Mordecai discovers a plot against the king. Mordechai encourages Queen Esther to rise up to defend the Jewish people by telling her that she has come to her royal position for such a time as this. Esther bravely calls a fast for 3 days and risks her life to approach the king to expose the plot against the Jewish people. She reveals her Jewish identity, and God turns the story around. The story culminates with the king ordering Haman's execution, Mordecai being elevated by the king, and a new edict written, allowing the Jews to defend themselves against their enemies. In the end, God gave the Jewish people victory over their enemies, and they celebrated with great feasting and joy!\n\n“On the 13th day of the 12th month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them. The Jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of King Xerxes to attack those determined to destroy them. No one could stand against them, because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them.” - Esther 9:1-2\n\nPurim traditions are designed to celebrate God’s miraculous deliverance of the Jewish people and to instill the story's lessons throughout generations. Some of these traditions include:\n\n“to have them celebrate annually the 14th and 15th days of the month of Adar as the time when the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration. He wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor.” - Esther 9:21-22\n\nTzedaka, the act of giving to the poor and the less fortunate, is a Purim cornerstone. Vision for Israel extends this biblical principle throughout the year, providing essential aid to those in need across Israel. In light of this Purim, we invite you to celebrate this holiday by giving gifts to the poor in Israel. To learn more about our work visit our projects page.\n\nThe eerie resemblance between Haman and Hamas is not lost on contemporary observers. Just as Haman cast lots to annihilate the Jewish people, Hamas launched an attack against Israel on October 7th, the day of Simchat Torah, seeking our destruction. But it didn’t end there. Following the attack and the subsequent war in Gaza, we are seeing a rise in antisemitism around the world today. This is a grave concern and we must learn from history.This parallel highlights the enduring struggle against antisemitism and the importance of unity, resilience, and vigilance in safeguarding Jewish lives and heritage against modern threats. Let us raise our voices against antisemitism and stand together with our Jewish brothers and sisters.\n\nGod’s message through the Purim story is that when His people stand in courage and trust in Him, He will deliver His people from the hands of their enemies. This holiday also serves as a call to action in today's world, reminding us of the importance of standing against oppression, supporting one another, and fostering a community bound by generosity and love. God's message through the book of Esther remains ever-relevant, and now more than ever, for Israel as we find ourselves still at war.Today, with many enemies surrounding Israel on all sides, we look to the Lord who is our deliverer and shield. He will protect and fight for His people. We expect to see Him do miracles and He will receive all the glory and honor for faithfully protecting His people and nation.

For the Jewish people, this month is centered around the book of Esther and the great celebration of Purim. The word ‘Purim’ means ‘lots’ and it is the celebration of how God turned the coming destruction into a time of joy and celebration!\n\n“On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, the edict commanded by the king was carried out. On this day the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but now the tables were turned and the Jews got the upper hand over those who hated them.” - Esther 9:1\n\nIn the book of Esther, evil and wickedness are expressed through Haman and his orders to kill the Jewish people. With a terrifying sentence of extermination, the Jews found themselves in a place of fear and without joy. However, when Esther approached the king on behalf of her people, she moved the heart of the king to write a new decree. This new ruling permitted the Jews to defend themselves against the attack of their enemies. Just in receiving this new decree, the Jews were filled with joy!\n\n“For the Jews it was a time of happiness and joy, gladness and honor. In every province and in every city to which the edict of the king came, there was joy and gladness among the Jews, with feasting and celebrating…” - Esther 8:16-17\n\nHowever, what is extraordinary about their joy at that moment is that they were choosing to rejoice in the Lord even before they received the victory of the battle that still awaited them. Their enemy still hated them and was determined to destroy them. And the Jews still had to face their enemies, fight against them, and destroy them. Yet, they chose to rejoice in the Lord because they fully believed that God was with them.So, as we approach this new month of Adar, how do we also choose to rejoice in the Lord, even in the midst of great suffering or persecution? First of all, we have to know that God is with us. Secondly, we need to receive the fruit of the Holy Spirit in the deep places of our hearts and minds. Only through the power of the Holy Spirit are we able to express genuine joy in the midst of very challenging situations.And thirdly, we need to give thanks to the Lord for everything! There is a great connection between gratitude and joy. When we give thanks to God, genuine joy begins to fill our hearts and strengthens us in faith, security, and fearlessness.There are many verses in the Bible that instruct us to ‘rejoice’, ‘be glad’, and ‘joy’. There are also many Hebrew words that refer to joy in the scriptures: ‘simcha’, ‘ditza’, ‘sasson’, ‘tzahala’, ‘rina’, ‘gilah’, ’hodaya’, and more. The word of God highlights just how important it is to rejoice in the Lord throughout our journey of faith here on this earth. Joy is living in faith without worry and without fear. Joy is fixing our eyes on Yeshua in the midst of our pain. Joy is a grateful heart.From all of our staff at VFI, we pray that you have a joy-filled holiday as you celebrate Purim!

The word of God highlights just how important it is to rejoice in the Lord throughout our journey of faith here on this earth. <br/><br/>Joy is living in faith without worry and without fear. Joy is fixing our eyes on Yeshua in the midst of our pain. Joy is a grateful heart.<br/><br/>From all of our staff at VFI, we pray that you have a joy-filled holiday as you celebrate Purim! <br/><br/><em>Chag Purim Same’ach</em>! Happy Purim! </p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nPurim is one of the most joyous holidays on the Jewish calendar. It commemorates a time when the Jewish people living in Persia were saved from extermination. The story of Purim is recounted in the Book of Esther, whose eponymous heroine plays the leading role in saving her people. This story is one of the most beloved in the Jewish community, because of the hope that it gives a minority living in an oftentimes hostile majority culture.\n\nThe word Purim (from the word pur) means “lots” and refers to the lottery that Haman used to choose the date for the destruction of the Jews. Purim is preceded by a fast called “The Fast of Esther”, which commemorates Esther’s three-day fast in preparation for her meeting with the king.\n\nThe holiday of Purim is celebrated on the 14th day of the month of Adar in the Jewish calendar, which is usually during February/March. This year Purim begins at sundown on February 25th.\n\nIn distinction to various other holidays, such as Pesach (Passover), Purim is the quintessential community holiday. Nonetheless, several activities are centered in the home. One of the favorite activities in preparation for the holiday is the baking of hamantaschen, the triangular filled pastries that are the traditional food at Purim time. In addition, following the commandment to give gifts to friends and the poor, the preparation of so-called mishloah manot baskets is a fun activity to engage in, as is their distribution on the holiday. The centerpiece of Purim’s home celebration is the seudah, a festive meal accompanied by alcoholic beverages.Purim is a community holiday of joyful celebration. The centerpiece of the communal celebration is the reading of the Scroll of Esther, the Megillah, in the synagogue. This is a raucous affair, with whoops, hollers, and noise being made every time that Haman’s name is mentioned, so no one can hear the name of this horrible evildoer. Another tradition is the Purim shpiel, the Purim play, during which fun is poked at community leaders and members. Purim has often been called the Jewish carnival, and dressing in costume and taking part in a Purim carnival heighten the levity of the day, on which one is encouraged to engage in activities that at other times of the year would be somewhat more restricted in scope, such as drinking.\n\nOnce upon a time, there lived a king named Ahasuerus, who reigned from India to Ethiopia, in Shushan the citadel, in Persia. He was very wealthy and loved to show off his riches. He hosted a big party that lasted 7 days and commanded his wife, Queen Vashti, to appear before him and his male guests at the party. Vashti refused and as a result, King Ahasuerus decided to find another queen. His search begins with a royal beauty pageant. The most beautiful young women in the kingdom are brought before the king, and Esther, whose Hebrew name was Hadassah, a young Jewish girl, is selected to be the new queen. Esther is portrayed as an orphan belonging to the tribe of Benjamin. She lives with her cousin Mordechai as a member of the Jewish exiles in Persia. At her cousin's behest, Esther conceals her Jewish identity from the king.Not long after Esther becomes queen, Mordechai offends the grand vizier, Haman, by refusing to bow down to him. Haman decides to punish not only Mordechai but all Jews for this slight. He informs King Ahasuerus that the Jews do not obey the king's laws and that it would be in the kingdom's best interest to get rid of them. He asks for permission to destroy them, which the king grants. Haman then orders the king's officials to kill all the Jews - \"young and old, women and children\" - on the 13th day of the month of Adar (Esther 3:13).When Mordechai learns of the plot he tears his clothes and sits in sackcloth and ash at the entrance to the city. When Esther learns of this, she orders one of her servants to find out what is troubling her cousin. The servant returns to Esther with a copy of the edict and instructions from Mordechai that she should beg the king for mercy on behalf of her people. This was not a simple request - at the time it had been thirty days since King Ahasuerus had summoned Esther and appearing before him without a summon was punishable by death. But Mordechai urges her to take action anyways, saying that perhaps she became queen so that she could save her people.“For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father’s house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this?” (Esther 4:14)Esther decides to fast before taking action and requests that her fellow Jews fast along with her.After fasting for three days, Esther puts on her finest clothes and appears before the king. He is pleased to see her and asks what she desires. She replies that she would like the king and Haman to join her at a banquet. At the banquet, the king asks Esther what she wants and she answers that she would like the king and Haman to come to another banquet the following day.Haman is delighted to hear this but is still so upset with Mordechai that he can't stop thinking about it. His wife Zeresh, and friends tell him to impale Mordechai on a pole if it will make him feel better. Haman loves this idea and immediately has the pole set up. However, that night the king decides to honor Mordechai because earlier in the story Mordecai had uncovered a plot against the king. He commands Haman to put the king's own robe on Mordecai and to take him around the city on the king's horse while proclaiming, \"This is what is done for the man the king delights to honor!\" (Esther 6:11). Haman reluctantly obeys and soon afterward goes to Esther's banquet.At the second banquet King Ahasuerus asks his wife again, what does she desire? She answers: \"If I have found favor with you, Your Majesty, and if it pleases you, grant me my life—this is my petition. And spare my people—this is my request. For I and my people have been sold to be destroyed, killed and annihilated.\" (Esther 7:3). The king is outraged that anyone would dare threaten his queen and when he asks who has done such a thing Esther declares that Haman is to blame. One of Esther's servants then tells the king that Haman had erected a pole upon which he planned to impale Mordechai. King Ahasuerus commands that Haman instead be impaled. He then takes his signet ring from Haman and gives it to Mordechai. Mordechai is also given Haman's estate and the king gives Esther the power to overturn Haman's orders.Esther issues an edict giving Jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves against anyone who may try to harm them. When the appointed day arrives, the Jews defend themselves against their attackers, killing and destroying them. According to the Book of Esther, this happened on the 13th day of Adar, \"and on the fourteenth [day] [the Jews] rested and made it a day of feasting and joy.\" (Esther 9:18). Mordechai declares that the victory would be remembered every year. The celebration is called Purim because Haman cast the \"pur\" (the lot) against the Jews, yet failed to destroy them.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nWithout question, the world is a different place than before March 2020—when most countries around the globe began their social distancing, quarantines, shutdowns, and other measures designed to ‘flatten the curve’ of the Coronavirus pandemic. And with some of the restrictions beginning to relax in Israel, it’s tempting to breathe a sigh of relief and assume that everything is back as it should be. But as you may recall, the economy in Israel—particularly as it worked for the poor—has been under serious strain. Resumption of daily life is happening, and will continue to happen—but the effects of job loss and unemployment, the rising welfare rolls, and other important economic indicators will take serious time and attention before a full recovery can be made. Health-wise, we may be out of the woods, but economically—Israel is very much on the ropes.\n\nIn the midst of the State of Israel’s reopening plan, a new survey finds that 40% of Israelis are having trouble paying for basic expenses as requests made to the Ministry of Welfare have increased by 50%. The survey, conducted by the IFCJ and the Geocartography Institute, paints an alarming picture of the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis. The survey was conducted among 600 Jewish and Arab respondents and serves as a representative sample of the population in Israel. “The survey results serve to underscore what most experts already suspected: Even though the medical emergency for the majority of the Israeli people is winding down, the economic and social impact caused by the COVID-19 crisis has been devastating” Yael Eckstein, President and CEO of the IFCJ said.\n\nMeanwhile, 42.6% of the survey participants cannot depend on their family members or friends for economic help, with about 13% already getting, or planning to request, assistance in the near future from non-profits or social service departments. (INN / VFI)\n\nIsrael’s new government was asked to approve a 1.5% budget cut, intended to fund the addition of new ministries, and the ministers and deputy ministers who will serve in them. It plans to distribute the cuts evenly across all ministries. Among them, the Welfare Ministry is expected to lose 3.6 million shekels from its budget, as well as 15 employees. There will also be cuts to the budgets of the National Insurance Institute, and the Israeli Employment Service, which are on the front lines helping Israelis recover financially from the coronavirus lockdown. The Health Ministry will lose 4.3 million shekels from its budget, along with 23 employees. The funds cut from the ministries' budgets will be used for the new ministries, as well as to open a Housing Headquarters in the Construction and Housing Ministry and a Planning Headquarters in the Interior Ministry. Each of these headquarters will have conditions similar to that of the Finance Ministry's Housing Headquarters. (INN / VFI)\n\nSocial Workers' Union Chairwoman Inbal Hermoni sent a warning letter to Finance Minister Yisrael Katz (Likud) and Welfare Minister Itzik Shmuli (Labor), warning them that social services are on the brink of collapse due to the coronavirus crisis, and the expected budget cuts. \"The State of Israel is in the midst of a social services crisis,\" she wrote. \"This can be seen by the overload in the number of families being managed by each social worker (between 100-400 families per social worker), by the acute lack of workers, with 1,000 social worker positions waiting to be filled, by the lack of resources and response in the community, the closure of frameworks providing services, the lack of response to tenders which the Welfare Ministry puts out to outsource services, and more.\" \"The coronavirus crisis brought with it a rise in the number of unemployed, as well as a rise in the emotional stress for the entire population, a deterioration in the mental state of populations which suffer emotional and functional problems during normal times, a rise in problems in parental functioning, in the violence...in family units, a rise in the number of people addicted to dangerous substances, and in general a dramatic rise in the number of families who require aid from social services and an increase in the needs of families which were already receiving social services before the crisis. \"During this period, we are again witnessing how crucial social work and social services are to maintaining the fabric and strength of society and handling the national challenges facing the State of Israel. We were therefore horrified to hear that cuts are expected to the number of positions and the resources of the Welfare Ministry at this time! At this time the response and the aid budgets should be expanded in order to allow Israeli society to cope during this difficult time, and certainly, there should not be cuts that will come at the expense of the residents of the entire State of Israel, especially at the expense of the weaker populations which require aid now, more than ever. \"It is my obligation to warn the State of Israel regarding the threat that social services will collapse, which will have serious consequences and almost certainly also cause a loss of life,\" she concluded. (INN / VFI)\n\nCOVID-19 has disproportionately affected those who live in poverty—particularly Israel’s growing immigrant community. With job discontinuation/reduction, lack of family support, and communication difficulties all piling on, many risk an already-dire health situation becoming an issue of food and housing insecurity. Recently, we at Vision for Israel went to distribute clothing and dry food packages for immigrant families—forced to live in crowded conditions (especially dangerous during a pandemic), many of them suffered from serious health problems as well. Founders Batya and Barry Segal went along to help, and to meet some of the families and got to know them personally. They met a lovely family of 6, with a girl suffering from Asthma. The father works at a retail store and is the sole financial provider for the family. Before COVID-19, he only earned the equivalent of $2100 USD per month—and since then, cuts to his work have reduced that even more. They also met the single mother of a 4-year-old girl, who had made Aliyah from Ethiopia in 1987. Due to postpartum depression, she has been on a steady regime of medication and therapy to this day. Since the father is not an Israeli citizen, she isn’t entitled to receive alimony from Social Security in Israel—and due to a car accident she was in about three years ago, she suffers from occasional loss of consciousness. This severely impacts her ability to work and provide for her small family. The poverty in Israel was terrible prior to the crisis, and it has only gotten worse since—and with the announced cuts to welfare programs, and the continuing economic crisis—it’s become clear that nonprofits and other NGOs will have to pick up where the government can’t.

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nYom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar, is a day of fasting and reflection. We all have fond memories of breaking the fast with family at the end of the Day of Atonement and looking forward to celebrating Sukkot. This day is so revered that it is never postponed, even when it lands on the Shabbat. It is central to the Jewish faith.Though the holiday has been honored and celebrated for centuries, Yom Kippur of 1973 stands out as a painful and tragic date. This day will be talked about for decades, via stories that hold immense pain, courage, and heroism. On Shabbat, October 6, 1973, the Yom Kippur War erupted, bringing a dark memory to this otherwise blessed day. The war began as Egyptian and Syrian soldiers advanced to reclaim land that they had lost during the famous Six-Day war of 1967. Israel was attacked simultaneously on the northern and southern borders. The attack was ordered by the president of Egypt at the time, Anwar el-Sadat. Though he wanted to make peace with Israel, he knew that his country’s poor economy and lost land would create unfavorable peacetime conditions for the Egyptians. He decided instead to attack Israel on the holiest of days.Because most Israeli soldiers were observing Yom Kippur with their families, there were fewer ready to fight the incoming armies. What happened next is destruction and desolation like we have never known. Batya shares her memories from this war: “I lived two houses from the Prime Minister's residence. Like every Yom Kippur, the streets were deserted, and there was not a single vehicle on the roads. There were no means of communication, as all the channels were off. Only the worshipers who come and go to the synagogue were seen on the streets from time to time. Everyone was weak and tired from the fast.At noon I heard vehicles driving on the road at breakneck speed. They just kept coming. I went out on the porch to see who dared to drive on Yom Kippur and found that the drivers were personnel and government ministers who had arrived at the home of Prime Minister Golda Meir.We knew something was wrong, so we turned on the radio to find out what was happening.“An IDF spokesman on the radio said: \"As of 2:00 PM, Egyptian and Syrian forces are attacking Sinai and the Golan Heights in the air and on land. After a series of airstrikes on our outposts and force camps, the infantry launched a ground attack. Egyptian forces crossed the Suez Canal in several places, and Syrian forces launched an armored and infantry attack along the line in the Golan Heights. IDF forces are working against the attackers, and in both sectors there are battles in the air and on land.\"The rest is history. Though its enemies tried to destroy Israel through this surprise attack, Israel gained territories that it had never intended to capture. Egypt had lost the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, Jordan lost the West Bank (Judea and Samaria) and East Jerusalem, and Syria lost the Golan Heights. Israel’s victory came at the cost of heavy casualties, and Israelis criticized the government’s lack of preparedness. That time is now described as \"a war heavy with days, and heavy with blood.”Testimony of an Israeli pilot:\n\n\"I was on a flight over the Suez Canal. We were on a mission to stop the Egyptian forces that tried in the masses of tanks and soldiers to enter the borders of Israel. I saw from the cockpit the incomparable balance of power, hundreds of enemy army tanks and thousands of Egyptian soldiers approaching and fighting. On the Israeli side, there were very few military forces to provide protection for the borders. From above it seemed shocking. It could end in a Holocaust and the destruction of an entire state, the State of Israel. I did not believe what I saw, and I said to myself, it can not be. Where is the balance of power?\n\nAir Force planes continued with continuous shelling and I saw the thousands of Egyptian soldiers advancing with almost no interruption and few forces of soldiers and tanks on the Israeli side.\n\nThen I sat in the cockpit and prayed for a miracle. I am a kibbutznik, and I was educated in a non-religious kibbutz. But suddenly I see an amazing spectacle. Masses of Egyptian soldiers returning towards Egypt, tanks retreating. Some of the enemy fighters raise a white flag and surrender, and I do not understand what is happening. I'm stunned and ask myself, what's going on down there?\n\nThis scene has not been erased from my memory and I remember that later when the war was forgotten in the warriors' discourse, I heard what had happened from the testimony of the Egyptian prisoners.\n\nHere is the story from the Egyptian side: As the Egyptians advanced toward Israel, they suddenly saw masses of Israeli soldiers. They were sure they were falling into a trap from which they wouldn’t come out alive. They did not understand where all these soldiers came from. Out of fear and anxiety they decided to surrender.\n\nI am the pilot. I saw from above the balance of power. I knew that there is a God in heaven, that he guards us with all his angels.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nHanukkah arrives each year, inviting us to kindle light in public spaces—windows, doorways, town squares—and to say with quiet courage that God’s faithfulness still burns. Yet for many Jewish families around the world, this season now prompts a sober question: Is it safe to place the Hanukkiah where neighbors can see? Reports from community groups, campus monitors, and law enforcement have documented a troubling rise in antisemitic incidents in recent years, especially since late 2023, after the October 7th attack by Hamas. Parents weigh whether their children should wear a Star of David to school. Synagogues coordinate with security teams. Public menorah lightings sometimes require police presence. The simple act of lighting candles has once again become an act of testimony.\n\nTo understand why this matters, we return to what Hanukkah actually commemorates. In the second century BCE, the Seleucid ruler Antiochus IV Epiphanes outlawed central commandments of Jewish life—Shabbat, circumcision, and study of Torah—and desecrated the Temple in Jerusalem. The Maccabees, a family of priestly leaders, rose in a grassroots revolt that reclaimed Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple. The festival that followed, eight days of dedication, celebrates God’s faithfulness and the preservation of Jewish identity under intense pressure to assimilate. Later rabbinic tradition preserves the beloved story of the cruse of oil that burned for eight days. Whether one emphasizes the military victory or the miracle of light, Hanukkah remains a season of rededication to God’s covenant and to the visibility of His light in the world.\n\nFor followers of Yeshua, Hanukkah carries an added resonance. The Gospel of John mentions that Yeshua was present in Jerusalem during the Feast of Dedication. He spoke in the Temple courts, engaging openly with questions about identity and mission. That short mention reminds us that Hanukkah is part of the spiritual landscape of the New Testament world, rooted in Israel’s story of perseverance and worship in the face of coercion.\n\n“Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Yeshua was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.” - John 10:22-24\n\nHave you noticed the connection between Hanukkah and the current rise in antisemitism? Notice how antisemitism adapts. It is not a single idea; it is a recurring pattern that recasts ancient hostility in modern terms. In one era, it accused the Jewish people of being too religious; in another, too secular. In one era, antisemitism wears the face of racial pseudoscience; in another, it emerges in conspiracy theories about finance, media, or globalism. At times, it targets the Jewish people’s faith and culture; at other times, it targets their national self-determination in the land of Israel. Different ideologies—far-right, far-left, and Islamist—can weaponize different myths, but the result is similar: Jewish people are singled out, maligned, excluded, threatened, or attacked simply for being Jewish.Recent research summaries from well-known organizations and community audits in both the US and UK show patterns that should concern all people of goodwill: record-high incident counts; sharp increases in harassment, vandalism, and assault; spikes around Jewish holidays and moments of conflict in the Middle East; and especially strong surges in schools, universities, and online spaces. Public expressions of Jewish identity—synagogue attendance, Hebrew school drop-off, wearing a kippah, displaying a mezuzah, lighting a menorah—too often become flashpoints for intimidation. Even when most incidents are not violent, the cumulative effect is fear, isolation, and a gnawing sense that Jewish neighbors must hide.\n\nThe Hanukkah story speaks right here. The Maccabees’ central conviction was not merely opposition to cultural tyranny; it was the insistence that God’s people must worship God publicly, with faithfulness shaping daily life. The candles are intentionally placed where they can be seen. Tradition calls for publicizing the miracle. The light is for the house, yes, but it is also for the street. Not everyone can or should take the same risks; prudence is real, and every household must weigh its circumstances wisely. Still, Hanukkah’s calling is not secrecy but holy visibility. Where antisemitism says, “Hide who you are,” Hanukkah replies, “Rededicate who you are to the Lord, and let your light shine.”\n\nThis season asks for more than sympathy. It invites solidarity rooted in Scripture and conscience. That begins with clarity of mind and speech. Antisemitism is not only personal hatred; it also includes narratives that deny the Jewish people’s right to live and flourish as Jews, whether in their communities abroad or in their ancestral homeland, Israel. Critique of any government is a normal part of civic life; demonization of a people is not. When double standards, dehumanizing language, or calls to erase Jewish presence appear, Christians should recognize those as warning signs. Silence in such moments does not feel “neutral” to Jewish neighbors; it feels like abandonment.Solidarity also takes the shape of hospitality. Reach out to Jewish friends and local congregations. Attend a public menorah lighting. Write a note to a rabbi or a community center. If your church hosts educational forums, include Jewish voices and credible experts on the nature of antisemitism. Teach your children and youth to discern online rhetoric, to spot conspiracy tropes, and to challenge unfair targeting of classmates. Where possible, partner with organizations that provide real help: trauma counseling, legal support, school security, assistance to vulnerable families, care for survivors of terror, and relief for communities under strain.\n\nWe can learn practical wisdom as well. Verify sources; do not share sensational content just because it confirms what you already suspect. Be wary of memes and out-of-context clips. Remember that Jewish communities are diverse; do not assume that one person or one headline speaks for all. When you see a double standard—one set of rules for the world’s only Jewish state and another for every other country—name it. When you hear someone dismiss a synagogue attack as mere “property damage,” remind them that such desecrations have always been precursors to worse.Hanukkah also calls us to hope. The shamash—the helper candle—lights all the others. It exists to serve. That is a profound picture for anyone who bears the Messiah’s name. The light you share may be a conversation with a fearful neighbor, a meal delivered to a displaced family, a scholarship for a child affected by terror, or a donation that equips first responders and strengthens communities in Israel. Each act becomes a small flame against the darkness.\n\nAt Vision for Israel, we are committed to being the shamash. In the wake of terror attacks and ongoing threats, we have distributed food and hygiene packages, equipped first responders and civilian security teams, and placed safety shelters in conflict areas. In holiday seasons, we provided store vouchers so families can choose essentials with dignity, warm clothing and winter kits, and practical assistance to make celebration possible. From the Millennium Center, our humanitarian logistics center, we continue to identify the places of greatest need and respond quickly with compassion and accountability. These are not abstract gestures; they are specific, measurable acts of mercy that help real people breathe again.If you are asking, “What can I do right now?” here is one faithful answer: help us keep the candles burning in homes that might otherwise go dark. Your generosity provides shelter during a rocket attack, a child receive a hot meal, a reserve soldier receive counseling after trauma, a family sit down to a holiday meal, and a volunteer medic arrive with lifesaving gear. It strengthens the fabric of Israeli society precisely where hatred tries to tear it.Please consider making a gift today so that, together, we can push back the darkness with tangible love for the people of Israel. Give securely here.Chanukah Same’ach—may we rededicate our hearts as we rededicate our homes, and may His Spirit empower us to stand with wisdom, courage, and joy.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,As we approach the one-year remembrance day of October 7, our hearts are heavy with the memories of one of the darkest days in Israel’s modern-day history. It was a day that changed everything, a day that tore at the very heart of our nation. Thousands of brutal terrorists invaded Israel in an unprecedented attack, leaving a trail of unimaginable devastation. 1,139 people were brutally murdered, about 250 hostages were taken into the Gaza Strip, and over 100 of them remain there even today.The horrific testimonies that have emerged from that day are beyond imagination in their cruelty. Yet, they are a grim reality that so many in Israel now live with. Survivors, both young and old, are carrying the heavy burden of trauma, trying to piece their lives back together.Among those who lived through this nightmare is 14-year-old Ella. On the morning of October 7, Ella woke up to the terrifying sounds of gunfire and people screaming in Arabic. She took refuge in a safe room with her mother, little brother, and a friend. As messages flooded in from friends on her kibbutz’s youth WhatsApp group, Ella read words no child should ever have to see: \"They shot my parents,\" \"We are dying, someone please help us.\"Ella's cousin, Amit, sent a final message that day, saying terrorists were inside his home. Soon after, all contact was lost. Later, Ella and her family were rescued by a special unit, but the trauma she endured is beyond words. \"There was blood everywhere,\" she recalls. \"Let me repeat this—I am 14 years old. These are not things a child my age, or any child, should see.\"In the face of such overwhelming darkness, stories of courage and survival shine through. Rahamim, a soldier stationed near the Gaza border, faced unimaginable danger that day. Waking up to sirens and the sound of rockets, he and his fellow soldiers quickly realized they were under attack. As terrorists infiltrated their outpost, Rahamim was struck in the face by a bullet, and a grenade landed just 10 centimeters from his leg. Despite his injuries, he fought on, driven by the training and resolve that had been instilled in him.With the help of a cook named Yaakobi, who courageously drove him to safety despite being wounded himself, Rahamim made it to Barzilai Medical Center. His story is a powerful reminder of the bravery and sacrifice of those who stand on the frontlines to protect our nation.In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Vision for Israel stepped in to provide critical aid. We supplied protective gear to emergency response teams, delivered essentials to soldiers suddenly called into action, and supported displaced families. But as we reflect on the past year, it is clear that our work is far from over.At the heart of our mission for the last 30 years is the belief that \"When a crisis hits, it’s too late to prepare.\" This year has shown us how vital it is to be ready for whatever challenges may come. As threats continue to loom over Israel, we must ensure that we are equipped to respond swiftly and effectively.We are incredibly grateful for your support, our faithful partners. Yet, the need remains urgent as the war is going on. We ask you to stand with us once again by donating to our emergency fund. Your generous contribution will help us provide the necessary resources to those on the frontlines, protect the vulnerable, and support Israel's civilian population.Let us honor the memories of the victims of October 7 by ensuring that we are ready to face the future with strength and resilience. Please consider making a generous donation today and dedicate it to Medical & Disaster Relief. Your contribution will help us prepare, protect, and provide for those who need it most.\n\nWith much appreciation,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

These individuals—mothers, fathers, children, and loved ones—carry deep emotional and physical wounds that require compassion, care, and meaningful rehabilitation. Tragically, the resources currently available are not enough to meet the growing need.At Vision for Israel, we are committed to standing in the gap. For over 25 years, we have served the people of Israel by offering support to those who need it most. Today, we are moving forward with a bold initiative to provide specialized rehabilitation programs for victims of terrorism and violence.Victims of terrorism experience trauma in different ways—some manage to rehabilitate successfully, while others struggle to recover. The lasting effects of these attacks turn victims into individuals who must fight for their wounded souls every day. Their daily functioning is impacted, which in turn affects families across Israel and influences society as a whole.Research has identified various methods for treating individuals who have experienced violence, terrorism, war, and other traumatic events. The primary goal is to support those who are mentally exhausted by developing personalized recovery plans that help them rebuild their lives. Our mission is to provide tailored and meaningful support to those in need.The current situation in Israel is extremely challenging, with entire communities deeply affected by the October 7, 2023, massacre. The demand for psychological and emotional support continues to grow daily, with an increasing number of applications from those in need. We believe this initiative will play a crucial role in healing and rehabilitating the affected populations. Many individuals who have long received support from Vision for Israel are now seeking to be part of this rehabilitation program.We have been diligently working to develop effective programs, but their implementation requires significant financial resources. While part of the budget is secured, additional funding is still needed to bring the project to life. Additionally, a skilled team of consultants and professionals in the field is essential to ensure the program’s success.Your support can help make a real difference in the lives of those who have endured immense hardship.Will you join us in this mission of hope? Your gift today will help us create a safe space where lives can be rebuilt and hearts can be renewed.

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe citizens of the State of Israel have found themselves in a very difficult economic situation causing even the most optimistic people to feel discouraged. Many in Israel have dreamt of buying a small apartment by saving every shekel they can to provide for themselves and their family. However, today, many citizens are just struggling to meet the basic living expenses every month.Since the Covid epidemic started in 2020, many lives have changed beyond recognition. Even workers who were in stable financial situations, have now found themselves in need. Some have returned to live in their parents’ homes. Others have left cities, like Jerusalem or Tel Aviv, due to the high cost of living and have moved to cities with more modest rents and lower costs of living.Recently, the annual poverty report for 2021 came out and shared some interesting findings. According to the National Insurance's annual poverty report of 2021, approximately 854,000 children and 212,000 pensioners were living below the poverty line which rose due to the increase in median income. No wonder businesses have closed, unemployment rates have risen, and workers have been laid off or gone on sick leave. And where did that leave the nation? Israel is now trying to rehabilitate itself little by little.Unfortunately, the highest increase in poverty was recorded among senior citizens: From 16.4% in 2020 to 17.6% in 2021. On the one hand, this could be caused by the cessation of special grants given in 2020, and on the other, it is due to senior citizens' small participation in the labor market.Another alarming figure is that between 2020-2021 there was an increase in the depth of poverty in most population groups, especially among ultra-Orthodox and Arabs. Up to 80% of the citizens are living below the poverty line.Families struggle to make ends meet and sometimes work several different jobs just to have something to feed their children. With increasing inflation, it is very likely that it will take a long time to eradicate the damage.Yoav Ben Tzur, a minister in the Ministry of Labor, said: \"We refuse to accept a reality in which senior citizens, children, and families live in poverty. This is a terrible thing that a reformed and moral society cannot accept. There are many ways to ensure an exit from poverty to a life with dignity and with the head held high. Diverse and adapted employment options for populations that need assistance are a necessary thing that will be promoted in the coming term in order to get out of the cycle of poverty, and we are currently working on a new plan for the benefit of all Israeli citizens.\"Just imagine seeing an elderly person open an empty refrigerator or giving up buying medication in order to eat a hot meal. Imagine the stress and weight parents are enduring because they are drowning in expenses as they try to provide for their family. And imagine the lone soldiers who are scraping every shekel to provide for themselves. Yet, against all odds, we have hope. We will march forward with all of our strength to build this nation up again with the generous backing of VFI donors, like you. Thank you for recognizing the critical need for continued action and increased support in fighting poverty here in Israel.Moving forward in 2023, Vision for Israel will continue to expand the circle of the recipients of aid and support.\n\nThe principles of mutual guarantee, social responsibility, empathy, compassion, and concern for the needs of the weak population in society should hold great value in every society.\n\n“You are not to twist justice for an outsider or orphan, and you are not to take as collateral a widow’s clothing. But you are to remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and Adonai your God redeemed you from there. Therefore I am commanding you to do this thing. “When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf in the field, you are not to turn back to get it. It is for the outsider, for the orphan and for the widow—in order that Adonai your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.” - Deuteronomy 24:17-19\n\nThis verse explains the basis of the principles of generosity and giving that have existed since biblical times. When Vision for Israel was established, this mindset penetrated deeply into our minds and hearts. We understand what a blessing it is to give wholeheartedly without expecting anything in return. And our greatest reward for giving is seeing the smiles on the faces of our recipients.Over the years, we have seen those in need giving their last pennies to help someone else in need. Locals contacted us because they wanted to give back to their community and volunteered by donating their time to pack food baskets, sort clothing, and more. This causes a chain reaction of small and large acts of generosity that connect us and encourages the weak to get through the most challenging times with dignity.Indeed, it is better to give than to receive, and to our delight, we were given the opportunity during 2022 to continue supporting those in need.VFI’s Impact in 2022:\n\nSo, what else can be done with the growing percentage of citizens in poverty and distress? How does Vision for Israel commit to helping in 2023?\n\nOur goal at Vision for Israel is to reduce poverty and restore life in the State of Israel. We want to support those who have fallen into an economic crisis not only with physical giving, but also with a loving hug, a listening ear, and a better understanding of their situation.Our hope is that at every encounter we can be a supportive shoulder to lean on. We want to remind those struggling with poverty that the struggle is temporary and that they are not alone. Together with us, they have the power to overcome this difficult situation.The amount of requests for assistance to families and individuals is expanding and growing. References multiply. Our cooperation with other organizations is also expanding. At Vision for Israel, we serve those in need while emphasizing the importance of empowering, strengthening, restoring, and building up each individual person.But what’s next? With the rising numbers of citizens living in distress, we find ourselves facing a new challenge.At the moment, the loyal and dedicated team of Vision for Israel is very small and is struggling to manage the large number of requests for help. The demand continues to increase. This is why we have decided in 2023 to expand our team in order to give more and reach those on the margins of society that we haven't been able to serve yet. The more we grow, the more impact we will make in this nation.Currently, we are able to provide aid to Holocaust survivors, the elderly, families in need, single mothers, victims of hostilities, lone soldiers, medical and disaster relief teams, and more! We also believe that with the additional help, we can give to even more all throughout the land of Israel.\n\nThis is a good opportunity for us to say to you — our generous donors and kind supporters — a huge thank you from the bottom of our hearts.Every time we distribute backpacks to children, dedicate a new shelter in the Gaza envelope, or hand out gift cards for the holidays, we remember you and your generous hearts. Imagine a Holocaust survivor sitting at home in the cold winter wrapped in a warm blanket and enjoying the warmth from a heater. Imagine a single mother putting food on the table for her kids. These little miracles and more were made possible because you decided to lend a helping hand that crossed borders and provided real hope to real people.We don’t take it for granted that you decided, despite the economic challenges in these last years, to faithfully give with all of your heart. Your tremendous kindness gives us the strength to continue fighting for the poor in Israel. With every box of food we pick up, all of the long hours we wait in traffic on the way to distribute food, or in the daily grind — we are strengthened and encouraged knowing you are standing with us through it all. This inspires us to continue to support the weak in the nation of Israel.Vision for Israel is honored to serve the State of Israel for more than 27 years now. And we will continue to do so in 2023 by supporting and providing help wherever possible.We pray that the work of your hands will be blessed and that together we will see the families of Israel rise to their feet and overcome poverty!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",
      "content_html": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\" style=\"color:white\">Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War</p><p>The citizens of the State of Israel have found themselves in a very difficult economic situation causing even the most optimistic people to feel discouraged. Many in Israel have dreamt of buying a small apartment by saving every shekel they can to provide for themselves and their family. However, today, many citizens are just struggling to meet the basic living expenses every month.<br/><br/>Since the Covid epidemic started in 2020, many lives have changed beyond recognition. Even workers who were in stable financial situations, have now found themselves in need. Some have returned to live in their parents’ homes. Others have left cities, like Jerusalem or Tel Aviv, due to the high cost of living and have moved to cities with more modest rents and lower costs of living.<br/><br/>Recently, the annual poverty report for 2021 came out and shared some interesting findings. According to the National Insurance's annual poverty report of 2021, approximately 854,000 children and 212,000 pensioners were living below the poverty line which rose due to the increase in median income. No wonder businesses have closed, unemployment rates have risen, and workers have been laid off or gone on sick leave. And where did that leave the nation? Israel is now trying to rehabilitate itself little by little.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the highest increase in poverty was recorded among senior citizens: From 16.4% in 2020 to 17.6% in 2021. On the one hand, this could be caused by the cessation of special grants given in 2020, and on the other, it is due to senior citizens' small participation in the labor market.<br/><br/>Another alarming figure is that between 2020-2021 there was an increase in the depth of poverty in most population groups, especially among ultra-Orthodox and Arabs. Up to 80% of the citizens are living below the poverty line.<br/><br/>Families struggle to make ends meet and sometimes work several different jobs just to have something to feed their children. With increasing inflation, it is very likely that it will take a long time to eradicate the damage.<br/><br/>Yoav Ben Tzur, a minister in the Ministry of Labor, said: <em>\"We refuse to accept a reality in which senior citizens, children, and families live in poverty. This is a terrible thing that a reformed and moral society cannot accept. There are many ways to ensure an exit from poverty to a life with dignity and with the head held high. Diverse and adapted employment options for populations that need assistance are a necessary thing that will be promoted in the coming term in order to get out of the cycle of poverty, and we are currently working on a new plan for the benefit of all Israeli citizens.\"</em><br/><br/>Just imagine seeing an elderly person open an empty refrigerator or giving up buying medication in order to eat a hot meal. Imagine the stress and weight parents are enduring because they are drowning in expenses as they try to provide for their family. And imagine the lone soldiers who are scraping every shekel to provide for themselves. <br/><br/>Yet, against all odds, we have hope. We will march forward with all of our strength to build this nation up again with the generous backing of VFI donors, like you. Thank you for recognizing the critical need for continued action and increased support in fighting poverty here in Israel.<br/><br/>Moving forward in 2023, </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nRosh Hashanah, which is celebrated on the first of the month of Tishri, marks the beginning of the Hebrew calendar. This special feast is mentioned in the scriptures as a holy convocation and a memorial of the blowing of trumpets.\n\n“Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a sabbath-rest, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work on it; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord.’” - Leviticus 23:23–25\n\nOn the first of the month of Elul, preparations begin for a period of special prayers in the synagogues. In the early morning hours, people gather in the synagogues to ask for forgiveness, for all the wrongdoings they have committed intentionally and unintentionally. Many Jews take their families on a special walk in the streets of Jerusalem, listening to the nostalgic melodies and pleasant traditional prayers emanating from the windows of the synagogues. Year after year, the people are taken back to their roots and reminded of the Jewish traditions they grew up with and the long history of Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews who have prayed in Jerusalem for many generations.\n\n“In returning and rest you shall be saved; In quietness and confidence shall be your strength.” – Isaiah 30:15\n\nRosh Hashanah is considered a 'Sabbath-rest'; for that reason, families gather around for a festive meal with relatives and friends as they light the candles and enjoy a meal comprised of foods that symbolize the new year:\n\nAnother Rosh Hashanah tradition is that people bless each other with 'Shana tova umetuka' (a good and sweet year) or ‘Shana tova ume’vorechet’ (a good and blessed year).\n\n“‘And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work. For you it is a day of blowing the trumpets.” – Numbers 29:1\n\nIn Hebrew, Rosh Hashanah (the 'head of the year') is also called Yom Teruah. The word teruah means \"to make a sound”. For this reason, this special holiday is marked by blowing the shofar (a ram's horn) in synagogues in Israel and worldwide. In the Bible, the sound of a trumpet blast was used as a special call as a warning, a time of mourning or war, or on joyous occasions – to proclaim the beginning of a festive and joyful event.\n\n“With trumpets and the sound of a horn; Shout joyfully before the Lord, the King.” - Psalm 98:6\n\nIn Israel, the shofar is blown in the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah in a series of three types of blasts:\n\n“Blow the trumpet at the time of the New Moon,\n\nAt the full moon, on our solemn feast day.” – Psalm 81:3\n\nIn this instance, the sound of the shofar is a joyous one, declaring a time of new beginnings and joy, but Rosh Hashanah is not only about welcoming the new year – the shofar also serves as a call to repentance and forgiveness.\n\nWhile most of the world celebrates their new year with fireworks, New Year’s resolutions, and counting down till midnight with a drink in hand, the biblical feast of the Hebraic new year is celebrated differently.Rosh Hashanah also begins a ten-day period leading up to the holiest day of the Jewish calendar Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement). On Yom Kippur, the priests would enter the Holy of Holies and repent on behalf of the people of Israel and ask that God would cleanse them of their sins. The ten days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur are dedicated to deep introspection, self-examination, and soul searching that results in repentance. As believers in Yeshua, we have confidence that our sins are atoned for and that we are made a new creation through His sacrifice.\n\n“Therefore if anyone is in Messiah, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. Now all these things are from God, who reconciled us to Himself through the Messiah and gave us the ministry of reconciliation. That is, in Messiah God was reconciling the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them; and He has entrusted the message of reconciliation to us. We are therefore ambassadors for Messiah, as though God were making His appeal through us. We beg you on behalf of the Messiah, be reconciled to God.” — 2 Corinthians 5:17-20 (TLV)\n\n“Then I will give them one heart. I will put a new Spirit within them. I will remove the heart of stone from their flesh and give them a heart of flesh…” — Ezekiel 11:19\n\nOnly through true salvation in Yeshua and a covenant between God and man can we stand before the King of Kings and be found righteous in the Messiah.\n\n“Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah — not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, says the Lord. But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put My law in their minds, and write it on their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.” — Jeremiah 31:31-33\n\nThe true hope of Rosh Hashanah is the hope of reconciliation, gratitude for forgiveness, a covenant relationship with Yeshua, and the miracle of becoming a new creation.As thousands of Jews gather to listen to the blowing of the shofar in the synagogues worldwide and in Israel, let it be a call to repentance, ushering in the days of great salvation and redemption.\n\nFor thus says the LORD:\n\n“Sing with gladness for Jacob,\n\nAnd shout among the chief of the nations;\n\nProclaim, give praise, and say,\n\n‘O LORD, save Your people,\n\nThe remnant of Israel!’” — Jeremiah 31:7\n\nAs we say in Israel: May you be the head and not the tail and have a 'Shana tova u'metuka'! We have hope, peace, and love and wish you all a happy and blessed new year!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

On Saturday, July 27th, at 6:18 in the evening, a rocket launched by Hezbollah hit the town, targeting a soccer field where around 60 children were playing. This horrific attack resulted in the tragic loss of 12 young lives and left 40 others injured.Just five days prior, on July 22nd, Vision for Israel had installed three safety shelters in Majdal Shams. In this moment of crisis, one of these shelters played a critical role in saving lives. Homeland Security reported to us that a doctor from Majdal Shams, who was present during the attack, confirmed that his son managed to run to one of our safety shelters and was saved. Despite being hit by the blast, the shelter protected nine children who were able to find refuge inside.The Homeland Security wrote to us on Sunday, one day after the attack:\n\n“We interviewed a doctor from Majdal Shams who was at the event, he said that his son did manage to run to the safety shelter and was saved in the end, he was hit by the blast but the safety shelter did save lives there. I heard... on News 13 saying 9 children managed to get into the safety shelter. We are also investigating this with the authorities to see how many more lives were preserved. Thank God some survived.”\n\nWe are grateful to God for these lives saved, yet our hearts break for the families mourning their lost loved ones. The impact of this attack is profound, and the need for safety and medical support in such vulnerable communities is more urgent than ever.Our team continues to work closely with local authorities to assess the full impact and provide the necessary support. Magen David Adom (MDA) informed us that one of our ambulances was present at the scene, aiding in the swift transportation of the injured to nearby hospitals. We are awaiting further updates on their conditions and are committed to supporting their recovery.In these times of sorrow and need, we turn to you, our faithful supporters. Your generosity enables us to provide life-saving resources and support to those affected by terror. We ask for your prayers for the victims and their families and for your continued support in our mission to protect and heal.Thank you for standing with us and for being a beacon of hope in the darkest of times.Help us continue our mission to protect and save lives in Israel.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nFor several years, Vision for Israel has had the immense privilege of supporting and collaborating with the organization of victims of hostilities in a special scholarship project for students who are victims of hostilities.Each year we gather to partner together to the point that this well-intended project, which started as a small endeavor, has become a tradition we refuse to miss.Victims of hostilities suffer significant long-term trauma and can often feel isolated from the memories and loss they have suffered as a result.As children and teenagers, they carry the heavy burden of trying to build a future for themselves through education, all while trying to solve complicated mental and emotional difficulties, either endured by their parents or themselves.We believe that providing education for students who are victims of hostilities, will help ease their way back into a normative life cycle, realize their academic abilities, and complete their education according to their skills.Education is of great importance in creating employment opportunities and contributes to improving their self-esteem and confidence. When they see that a whole system of adults believes in their well-being, taking care of their future, and cheering them on -- it shrinks the goliath-size difficulty they stand against.Projects like this are critical and are contributing factors in rehabilitating terror survivors who attend higher education institutions.This year, we were honored to host the scholarship distribution ceremony at the Millennium Center in a festive setting.The students were accompanied by relatives and friends and were greeted with a colorful reception filled with light and rich refreshments, including quality sandwiches, savory pastries, cookies, and cold and hot drinks. In the background, bringing much joy to the event was musician and singalong emcee Shalom Har-Even, which elevated the celebration with his upbeat music.Each student then received a check and a certificate of appreciation in person, accompanied by a melody, and had the opportunity to share about themselves, and their course of study.This year we were able to award 76 scholarships to students who were most in need of the blessed assistance.It was an exciting and very empowering evening. Seeing the smiles on the faces of the children, knowing that we had a small hand in guaranteeing their success as successful members of society, was the highlight of the evening. We are grateful for the fruitful cooperation with the representative organization through which we have been able to touch more and more families in need of assistance and improve their quality of life.We look forward to continue supporting survivors of hostilities and their children as they walk bravely into their destinies by dedicating our resources to better their life and education.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

The most vulnerable among us – families struggling to make ends meet, single parents, and those living below the poverty line – are suffering the most. Over 530,000 families, including 665,000 children, live in food insecurity. This is a reality we cannot ignore.At Vision for Israel, we've seen firsthand the distress that these families face each day. People like Ya'ara*, a single mother of four children, three of whom have autism. Despite holding a master's degree and working as a teacher, Ya'ara struggles to cover her basic needs due to the rising cost of living. We've been privileged to support Ya'ara with laptops, school bags, holiday gift cards, and more over the years. But the need is far from being fully met.Vision for Israel has been providing food baskets and gift cards, valued at around $100, to dozens of families every month. These baskets include dry items, legumes, canned food, and gift cards for grocery stores so families can also purchase fresh food. But as the cost of living continues to rise, so does the need for our help.This is where you can make a difference.Your generous donation to our Family Aid fund can provide immediate relief to families like Ya'ara's. Every $100 raised can provide another food basket to a family in need. But it's more than just food; it's a message to these families that they are not alone in their struggle. It's a beacon of hope in their challenging journey.Let's stand together to ensure no family in Israel goes hungry. Let's bring relief to those who are struggling and show them that there is light at the end of the tunnel.Visit our website www.visionforisrael.com to donate and make a difference.Thank you for your ongoing support and generosity.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,Passover is a season of renewal and redemption, a time to reflect on God’s faithfulness in delivering His people from bondage to freedom. As Jewish believers in Yeshua, we see the beauty of this season not only in remembering the Exodus from Egypt but also in the ultimate redemption we have through Him. It is a time of family gatherings, storytelling, and giving thanks for the blessings of freedom.But for many families in Israel, this season is overshadowed by struggle. Instead of preparing for a festive meal, thousands of parents worry about how they will put food on the table. The ongoing war has deepened financial hardship, adding many more families to the cycle of poverty. Inflation has driven up the cost of food and daily essentials, making it even more difficult for struggling households to observe Passover. Because eating kosher for the holiday requires replacing food and utensils, expenses increase significantly—an overwhelming burden for those already living paycheck to paycheck.Every year, Vision for Israel provides gift cards to families in need, helping them purchase food and essentials for the holiday. This year, we are increasing the amount each family receives for 1,200 families across the country who are receiving this aid. Yet the need remains great and overwhelming.The L. family from Yerucham, a small town in southern Israel, is one such family. With three children, ages 5, 9, and 14, the parents work tirelessly to provide for their household. The father, despite dealing with significant health challenges, is studying cooking at a college in Be’er Sheva to build a better future. The mother works full-time as a cleaner, even though she lives with just one kidney. They do everything they can to improve their circumstances, yet they still struggle to afford even the most basic needs.This Passover, will you help families like the L. family experience the joy of the season?Your generosity can make a real difference:\n\nPassover is meant to be a time of joy, faith, and celebration—a reminder of God’s power to redeem and restore. Your support brings more than just food; it brings hope, dignity, and the reassurance that they are not alone.As we gather around our own tables and retell the story of Exodus, let us extend God’s love by providing for those who are struggling. This is our opportunity to be a blessing to the people of Israel in their time of need.Please give today and help bring hope and provision to families in Israel this Passover.Chag Pesach Same’ach,Barry & Batya\n\nP.S.Please remember to pray for the remaining hostages that are still in Gaza.

      "title": "Shavu'ot—Feast of Weeks (Pentecost)",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe meaning of the word Shavu’ot is “weeks,” and is celebrated 7 weeks after the second day of Passover. In the Christian tradition, it’s known as Pentecost—a Greek term that means “fiftieth,” referring to the fact that it happens roughly 50 days after Easter. It was originally a harvest festival but later came to commemorate the giving of the Torah to the nation of Israel assembled at Mount Sinai. Later still, Christians came to know it as the day the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus, while they were in Jerusalem celebrating Shavu’ot. It’s a time of layered significance and deep appreciation for the blessings God has bestowed upon His people.\n\nWhen the Jews settled in the Promised Land, the meaning of Shavu’ot was transformed into an agricultural holiday that celebrated the Lord’s provision for His people. Exactly seven weeks after the first harvest of barley, Jews would come to the tabernacle to present the first fruits of their spring crops before the Lord. Since Shavu’ot occurs 50 days after Passover, the Greek translators of the Torah called it “Pentecost”. The first fruits of the crops were called Bikkurim and referred especially to the seven species of the Promised Land: barley, wheat, grapes, figs, pomegranates, dates, and olives (Deut. 8:8). As soon as a Jewish farmer would see the first signs of ripening fruit, he would tie a string or ribbon around it and designate it as Bikkurim. Later he would pick the fruit, put it in a basket, and journey to the tabernacle/Temple for the festival of Shavu’ot. Since it was a pilgrimage holiday, there would be a large procession of Jewish farmers carrying the baskets on the road, singing songs of joyful praise. At the tabernacle/Temple, each family would present the basket of fruits to the priest to be put before the alter, while reciting a passage from the book of Deuteronomy. In the priestly service, the 49-day countdown to the holiday is called “Sefirat Ha’omer,” or the counting of the Omer. On Shavu’ot, a sample of the first crop of wheat harvest was brought to the priests, baked into 2 loaves of leavened bread, and then waved before the altar as a concluding rite of the season. This was the only time leavened bread was used in the priestly service.\n\nAfter the Temple was destroyed in A.D. 70, the agricultural aspect of Shavu’ot could no longer be observed. So the Sages re-connected the festival with the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai—because it was on Shabbat morning of the 6th of Sivan, exactly 7 weeks after the Exodus, that the Lord descended amidst thunder, lightning, smoke, fire, and the blast of the shofar. He then declared the foundation of moral conduct required of the people—the Ten Commandments. Thus, Shavu’ot became known also as Zman Matan Torah – “The Season of the Giving of the Torah.”\n\nSince Shavu’ot is identified as the time of the giving of the Torah, activities, and customs about receiving the Torah are prevalent at this time. Each Jew is commanded to consider himself personally involved in Sinai. Therefore, on Shavu’ot, Jews reaffirm their commitment to the Mosaic covenant and the Jewish way of life. During synagogue services, everyone stands as the Ten Commandments are recited and everyone ratifies them with “Kol asher diber Adonai na’aseh ve’nishma,”—\"All the words which the Lord has said we will do and obey (hear).” Other customs include decorating the home and synagogue with greenery, eating dairy foods, and staying up all night studying Torah.\n\nIt is customary to read the book of Ruth at this time since the events recounted took place during the time of the spring harvest, and Ruth is a picture of the gentiles’ willing acceptance of a Jewish lifestyle and embracing the God of Israel. Ruth the Moabite symbolizes the ability to create a strong and faithful connection between people, even if they are strangers, or significantly different from one another. Ruth, whose name means, “friendship”, follows Naomi, her mother in law and friend, with love and uncompromising faithfulness. She chooses the warmth of dedication over the coldness of foreignness and manages to bring people together against all odds. That is her greatness. The essence of Vision for Israel’s charitable work is to bring hearts together, creating friendships and collaboration in our common goal for a better future. It is our privilege to stay faithful to these principles along the way. It is thanks to our faithful supporters around the world that we can reach these goals.\n\nAs one of the three pilgrimage festivals in the Old Testament, Jews from all over the world would come to Jerusalem to celebrate and reaffirm their commitment to the covenant of Moses. The New Testament reveals that Shavu’ot is the climax of God’s plan for our deliverance through Yeshua the Messiah. The countdown to Shavu’ot represents the giving of the anticipated New Covenant to mankind since it was on this very day that the Holy Spirit was given to form the Church of God. Shavu’ot marks the day when God entered into a covenant with the Jewish nation. During the first Shavu’ot at Mt. Sinai, God instituted the Mosaic covenant and gave the Torah in a written form. But during Shavu’ot, after Yeshua’s resurrection, God established the New Covenant when He wrote the Torah on the hearts of Yeshua’s followers.

      "content_html": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\" style=\"color:white\">Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War</p><p>The meaning of the word Shavu’ot is “weeks,” and is celebrated 7 weeks after the second day of Passover. In the Christian tradition, it’s known as Pentecost—a Greek term that means “fiftieth,” referring to the fact that it happens roughly 50 days after Easter.  <br/><br/> It was originally a harvest festival but later came to commemorate the giving of the Torah to the nation of Israel assembled at Mount Sinai. Later still, Christians came to know it as the day the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and other followers of Jesus, while they were in Jerusalem celebrating Shavu’ot. <br/><br/> It’s a time of layered significance and deep appreciation for the blessings God has bestowed upon His people. </p><p>When the Jews settled in the Promised Land, the meaning of Shavu’ot was transformed into an agricultural holiday that celebrated the Lord’s provision for His people. <br/><br/> Exactly seven weeks after the first harvest of barley, Jews would come to the tabernacle to present the first fruits of their spring crops before the Lord. Since Shavu’ot occurs 50 days after Passover, the Greek translators of the Torah called it “Pentecost”.<br/><br/> The first fruits of the crops were called <em>Bikkurim </em>and referred especially to the seven species of the Promised Land: barley, wheat, grapes, figs, pomegranates, dates, and olives (Deut. 8:8). <br/><br/> As soon as a Jewish farmer would see the first signs of ripening fruit, he would tie a string or ribbon around it and designate it as <em>Bikkurim</em>. <br/><br/> Later he would pick the fruit, put it in a basket, and journey to the tabernacle/Temple for the festival of Shavu’ot. Since it was a pilgrimage holiday, there would be a large procession of Jewish farmers carrying the baskets on the road, singing songs of joyful praise. <br/><br/> At the tabernacle/Temple, each family would present the basket of fruits to the priest to be put before the alter, while reciting a passage from the book of Deuteronomy. <br/><br/> In the priestly service, the 49-day countdown to the holiday is called “<em>Sefirat Ha’omer,”</em> or the counting of the Omer. <br/><br/> On Shavu’ot, a sample of the first crop of wheat harvest was brought to the priests, baked into 2 loaves of leavened bread, and then waved before the altar as a concluding rite of the season. This was the only time leavened bread was used in the priestly service. </p><p>After the Temple was destroyed in A.D. 70, the agricultural aspect of Shavu’ot could no longer be observed.<br/><br/> So the Sages re-connected the festival with the giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai—because it was on Shabbat morning of the 6th of Sivan, exactly 7 weeks after the Exodus, that the Lord descended amidst thunder, lightning, smoke, fire, and the blast of the shofar. He then declared the foundation of moral conduct required of the people—the Ten Commandments.<br/><br/> Thus, Shavu’ot became known also as <em>Zman Matan Torah</em> – “The Season of the Giving of the Torah.”</p><p>Since Shavu’ot is identified as the time of the giving of the Torah, activities, and customs about receiving the Torah are prevalent at this time. <br/><br/> Each Jew is commanded to consider himself personally involved in Sinai. Therefore, on Shavu’ot, Jews reaffirm their commitment to the Mosaic covenant and the Jewish way of life. During synagogue services, everyone stands as the Ten Commandments are recited and everyone ratifies them with “<em>Kol asher diber Adonai na’aseh ve’nishma,”—\"</em>All the words which the Lord has said we will do and obey (hear).”<br/><br/> Other customs include decorating the home and synagogue with greenery, eating dairy foods, and staying up all night studying Torah.</p><p>It is customary to read the book of Ruth at this time since the events recounted took place during the time of the spring harvest, and Ruth is a picture of the gentiles’ willing acceptance of a Jewish lifestyle and embracing the God of Israel. <br/><br/> Ruth the Moabite symbolizes the ability to create a strong and faithful connection between people, even if they are strangers, or significantly different from one another. Ruth, whose name means, “friendship”, follows Naomi, her mother in law and friend, with love and uncompromising faithfulness. She chooses the warmth of dedication over the coldness of foreignness and manages to bring people together against all odds. That is her greatness.<br/><br/> The essence of </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>",

As we celebrate the high holiday of Rosh Hashanah, our thoughts and prayers are with those living in uncertainty and fear, especially in the north and south of Israel.The escalating situation along the northern border with Lebanon has brought anxiety and danger closer to home for many families. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant recently urged the United Nations to strengthen their peacekeeping force, UNIFIL, to monitor the increasing potential for escalation due to Hezbollah's military build-up. Hezbollah's breach of Israeli territory by placing a military tent, and the establishment of dozens of other military compounds, have further heightened tensions. Coupled with the continual rocket attacks from Gaza, which Iran is also involved in financing and arming, it's clear that now, more than ever, we must provide added defense to the residents of both the north and south of Israel.In the last two years, we've been diligently working to place mobile shelters, mostly in the southern regions, to protect residents suffering from recurring rocket attacks. Now, with Hezbollah active along the border and Iran pressing its proxy group to attack Israel, we believe the time has come to expand our mobile shelters project into the northern communities as well.So far, VFI placed 155 mobile shelters in southern and northern Israel. Over the next two months, we'll place approximately 50 additional shelters across Israel, both in the north and the south. Each shelter costs $12,000.

Even in times of rest or personal time, we are constantly thinking and praying for those who need our help. We always want God’s love to be felt by all.Our hearts are always with the people of southern Israel, not only in times of trouble but throughout the year. Vision for Israel supports the victims of terrorism and violence in various ways, including monthly financial assistance, distribution of school bags to children, and holding events for them. These events allow them to get out of the house and relax mentally and physically in a safe space.During the increasingly common \"Code Red\" alerts, the residents of the south are forced to leave everything and reach a protected area within a few seconds. Failure to reach a shelter can result in injury or, God forbid, death. This kind of pressure is hard on the nervous system, and the people living in this area are in a constant state of fight or flight. Many suffer mental illness because of the constant stress and fear that they won’t be able to find shelter in time.Thanks to our loyal friends and donors, Vision for Israel recently placed 9 mobile shelters throughout the Gaza Envelope settlements, including Okafim, Netivot, Kibbutz Nir Am, Giv’olim, Dorot, and Gevim. Overall, a total of 30 shelters have been placed thanks to the donors of Vision for Israel, and we are planning on donating another 30 shelters as soon as we are able. All shelters are located near public spaces, parks, schools, neighborhoods, and shopping centers so that the maximum number of people have access in case of an emergency.Even during quiet days, the presence of the shelters close by gives locals a sense of security and peace of mind, as much as is possible in a violent zone. Being allowed to go about normal life is a rare gift for the people in these areas, and many are very grateful.We received words of thanks from the people of the south, and we were moved and touched by the gesture. We pray that days of peace and security will come soon and that they will never need shelters again.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

My dear father and mother passed away a few years later from broken hearts at a very young age.To my bitter fate, I am a father whose lovely daughter died at a young age, and my eldest nephew (19 years old) lost his life while serving as a border police fighter during a conflict in the city of Hebron.And now my beloved wife Rachel is severely disabled. We \"live\" on pensions from the National Insurance Institute, which leaves us with nothing; we've had to take out various loans for unexpected medical treatments and are burdened by a case of a writ of execution.With the help of God, I now turn to you for urgent help since my wife underwent complex eye surgery in the last two months and is now in need of special glasses.I ask that you would help us with a financial donation so that we can exist in a way that the remainder of our human dignity will not be taken away from us.“\n\nFor couples such as Shlomo and Rachel, life has not been kind.We may not be able to prevent every tragedy, but we can be the vessels that restore dignity to those stripped of the means to sustain themselves and restore their sense of purpose - one act of kindness at a time.Thankfully, because of your tremendous support and generosity, we were able to provide Rachel with special glasses to improve her eyesight, regain her health and improve the quality of her life.We were overjoyed when we received a heartwarming letter from Shlomo, thanking us for our help:\"I have a special reason to tell you again - thank you! Thank God you stand by my side during this difficult and exhausting time. You are undoubtedly the engine that drives my heart to love life despite my many difficulties. You are beautiful proof that there are still people who help those disabled from terror attacks.I am thankful from the bottom of my heart that you have always dealt with me with sensitivity, professionalism, and friendship - it is a great privilege for me to be treated by your organization. Your investment in my wife and me is priceless.“*All names have been changed to protect the identity of these individuals.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\n“Lag B’Omer” means “33rd day of the Omer,” which is the day this Jewish holiday is celebrated annually. This year, Lag Ba’Omer is celebrated on May 26. This holiday can be confusing because it is celebrated during the 49 days of the counting of the Omer. God commanded the counting of the omer for 49 days leading up to Shavuot, the Feast of Weeks, or Pentecost, meaning the 50th day. So, tucked in the middle of this biblically commanded counting of the omer is a man-made holiday, Lag Ba’Omer. Many Israelis celebrate this minor holiday, and orthodox Jews celebrate this day to commemorate the history of Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. Some believe that in the time of Rabbi Akiva, a plague killed 24,000 students of Rabbi Akiva as they were counting the Omer. It is believed that this plague was sent from God because the students were not showing respect for one another. However, on Lag Ba’Omer, the plague stopped, which is why some celebrate this day as a day of joy amid sorrow and loss. Others believe that this was the day to celebrate or memorialize Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai — a famous leader of the Jewish mysticism belief, Kabalah. Many are still not sure if it was the day he died or just a day to honor him, but either way, some orthodox Jews go to Mount Meron to worship the dead rabbi at his tomb. Many also lay on his tomb hoping to receive some of his spirit.\n\nWhat is this minor Jewish holiday famous for? ... Bonfires, weddings, and haircuts for 3-year-olds.On this holiday, you will smell smoke in the air, as some orthodox Jewish people build bonfires in memory of Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai to represent the “spiritual light” he brought into the world. Others choose to get married on this day because according to Kabbalistic belief, it is a day of spiritual splendor. And lastly, most commonly among Hassidic Jews, it is tradition to take their 3-year-old boys to the grave of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai to give their sons their first haircut.Many secular Israelis also celebrate this day by lighting bonfires, and roasting potatoes and onions in the coals, but without the religious significance that the orthodox Jews commemorate. Many schools organize a class activity around that on the eve of Lag Ba’Omer and some families do it just for fun.\n\n“From the day after the Sabbath, the day you brought the sheaf of the wave offering, count off seven full weeks. Count off fifty days up to the day after the seven Sabbath, and then present an offering of new grain to the Lord.”– Leviticus 23:15-16\n\nThe counting of the Omer is a command from the Lord given to the People of Israel to count the days between Passover and Shavuot and to give an offering of grain to the Lord. Because God commanded this in His word, it is biblical for Christians to count these days and celebrate Shavuot (Feast of Weeks) on the 50th day. We also recognize that the 50th day after Passover was when the Holy Spirit was poured out, also known as Pentecost. So, we count the Omer, but we may want to consider whether or not to celebrate Lag B’Omer.\n\nAt VFI we believe God has commanded us to celebrate the biblical Feasts, and Lag Ba’Omer is not mentioned in the Bible. As we learned, this holiday is steeped in mysticism, worship of the dead, and kabbalistic rituals.So, what can we as believers in Yeshua do on this day? We can pray! Pray for those here in Israel who believe in these Kabbalistic views to encounter the fear of the Lord, repent from worshipping rabbis, and turn their hearts back to our God. Pray for a spirit of repentance and a heart of worship of the one true God.It is important to recognize that not every Jewish holiday is biblical. So, let us remember to seek the Lord in His word to discern what is from Him and what is not. And as we continue to count the days of the Omer, let our hearts be filled with expectancy for the biblical holiday of Shavuot. This year may our hearts be fully open to the Lord to offer Him all that we are, and may He fill us afresh with more of His Holy Spirit!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

As the shofar sounds across the Land of Israel, its call rings out not only in celebration—but in urgent appeal.Today, 43% of Israelis report having to forgo even basic necessities due to financial strain. The cost of living has surged, and behind every statistic is a real person—someone just trying to survive.At Vision for Israel, we’ve seen this need firsthand. In preparation for the High Holidays, we’ve distributed gift cards to over 1,260 families—each receiving about $100—to help them buy food, clothing, and essentials for the new year. But the need continues to rise.Let us tell you about G. He has served faithfully in Israel’s Air Force reserves since October 2023, putting in countless hours to protect the country he loves. G. and his wife have two young daughters. Before the war, he launched a small handyman business to provide for his growing family. But when duty called, that business had to stop.Then, last Rosh Hashanah, tragedy struck. On his way home for the holiday, G. was injured in a serious car accident. Since then, he’s faced ongoing medical issues, and his wife—crippled by anxiety—has struggled to care for their children. Their rent is high, their bills are overdue, and they are in desperate need of both financial and emotional support.This is just one family among many.As we dip apples into honey this year, let’s remember those for whom this season feels more bitter than sweet. Together, we can turn that bitterness into sweetness—offering help, dignity, and the love of Yeshua to families in crisis.Will you answer the shofar’s call and help us deliver food and hope to families across Israel?Your Rosh Hashanah gift of $100 or more will help another struggling family—like G’s—receive the resources they need for the high holidays and beyond.Please give today.From our hearts to yours—may your new year be sweet, full of joy, and marked by acts of compassion.Shana Tovah,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Across the nation, 17,000 people have been forced from their homes due to ongoing conflict. Many of them fled with only the clothes they were wearing. In a matter of moments, homes, vehicles, and entire neighborhoods were reduced to rubble. Thousands of buildings have been destroyed. Thousands of lives were turned upside down.Among the evacuees are families caring for infants, children, and elderly parents.

These children are living in unfamiliar surroundings, far from their schools, friends, and the safety of home. Parents are doing their best to keep them calm, but the weight of uncertainty is unbearable.At Vision for Israel, we’re responding with compassion, speed, and determination.

You’re ensuring that a family has a warm place to sleep tonight.We believe the heart of the Father breaks for these families—and that He is calling His people to respond. This is your opportunity to act on that calling and become an instrument of healing in the land of Israel.Please give now to help Vision for Israel bring relief and restoration to families in crisis at visionforisrael.com/en/donateYour generosity today can bring peace, warmth, and reassurance to those walking through the darkest valley.With heartfelt thanks and blessings,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

On June 26, we celebrated the dedication of our 9th ambulance, a specially ordered 4x4 vehicle designed to reach challenging areas. This remarkable occasion was marked by a heartfelt ceremony at the Millennium Center, where we were honored to host 55 Holocaust survivors.In the past week, we have also made strides in expanding our fleet. We ordered another white ambulance for Magen David Adom (MDA), which is expected to arrive from GMC in the USA within 5-6 months. Additionally, a new MICU yellow ambulance is being built by Mercedes in Europe, and we will soon order another MICU ambulance from the UK/Europe, thanks to a generous gift from one of our dedicated donors. When these vehicles are completed, our total will reach 12 ambulances, significantly enhancing our ability to provide lifesaving services.Recently, we attended an MDA event in Tel Aviv and had the pleasure of meeting some of the dedicated staff and volunteers. We are still waiting for the latest statistics, but we can share that our donated vehicles have responded to over 50,000 emergency calls, including numerous births in our MDA ambulances.A particularly memorable moment occurred on June 27, 2024, when we were placing a safety shelter on the main highway road along the northern border heading towards Kiryat Shmona. An MICU ambulance, coming from Katzrin in the Golan Heights with its siren blaring, passed by us. To my amazement, we recognized it as one of the ambulances we had donated a few years ago, proudly displaying our name: Vision for Israel & The Joseph Storehouse.Here is a summary of our current fleet and upcoming additions:- 9 ambulances in active service- 3 more ambulances on order for delivery in the next 6-12 months- 4 medicycles- 1 mobile blood donation vehicle- 3 ATVs for fire extinguishing and rescue operations in Judea and SamariaYour unwavering support has made all these achievements possible. While this update is primarily to share our progress, if you feel moved to contribute further to our cause, your generosity will always be greatly appreciated.Thank you for standing with us and for your continued support and prayers.Stay connected with us and learn more about our ongoing projects HERE.\n\nShalom and blessings,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

This seven-day celebration is a time to remember the exodus of the Jewish people from Egypt, the 40 years of their wandering in the desert, and the miracle that they are still a people and nation today. The nation of Israel is going through difficult and turbulent times these days. Now, more than ever, it is important that we remember that we are one nation. Unity is a necessity, especially in the face of challenges. Unity requires us to be inclusive, give mutual respect and compassion, and help those in need.While we are all running around going to stores, choosing another outfit, and buying more ingredients for another meal or dessert, many families barely have enough money for food. Those that are suffering from poverty don't even dream of setting a dignified holiday table, and certainly not wearing festive clothes at the dinner table.Vision for Israel takes care of these families during the holiday, and every year gives them gift cards to purchase food and clothing for the holiday.This year, we made it a goal to give out 1000 gift cards. Thanks to your generous contributions, we were able to meet this goal and distributed about 1000 gift cards in many cities across the country. The donations went to families in need, lone soldiers, Holocaust survivors, and victims of hostilities.When you read about the number of the poor and needy in Israel, it is hard to imagine the faces behind the numbers. It is important for us as an organization to meet the people in person, get to know them, hear their stories, and lend an ear and a supportive shoulder.At the distribution points, we met wonderful people who shared their life stories with us:A mother of five children, in her thirties, told us that she has to support her family alone because her husband has cancer. We were grateful to be able to help this woman and her family, especially during the holiday.A father of a family underwent 11 surgeries and recently had open-heart surgery. It is very difficult for him to get around, and he needs a lot of help. He thanked us for the assistance both in the past and this year.A separated father of two children suffers from many health problems and lives only on the National Insurance stipend. Some of his health issues include lung failure, throat surgery, including a tube that was inserted into his throat, and many surgeries on his legs, some of which failed, and he still needs more surgeries. His condition is very serious, and he is in excruciating pain. He thanked us for the assistance and told us that our help has truly saved his life.This Passover let us stand with those in need by making an extra effort to help them to celebrate this holiday with joy and dignity. This is our contribution to the unity of the people of Israel!We pray for you to celebrate this Passover with joy, abundance, and unity!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "title": "Sukkot - Living Water in Abundance",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe Feast of Tabernacles (Sukkot) is one of three High Holidays in the Jewish calendar and one of the more joyful (Leviticus 23:40) celebrations — commemorating the miracles God performed for the people of Israel when He took them out of Egypt, their wandering in the wilderness for 40 years and God's faithfulness.During Sukkot people in Israel are building booths (sukkot) wherever they can, on balconies, in gardens and communal courtyards, and even on sidewalks for restaurant diners. The Sukkah is usually made of decorated tarps as walls held up by metal poles and a roof of palm branches (spread out enough to see the stars). Inside the Sukkah, we place a table and chairs since all the meals are eaten in the sukkah, and decorate it wall to wall with colorful string decorations, lights, and sometimes fake fruit since the holiday celebrates the yearly harvest, which takes place in the fall.As it is commanded to dwell in the booth for seven days, many religious Jews will put mattresses in the Sukkah and sleep beneath the stars.Where did this special feast start? Let's explore its origins in the book of Leviticus.\n\nWhen God took the people of Israel out of Egypt, they wandered the desert and lived in tents for forty years before finally entering the promised land.But God desired to give them a home, a safe place where he could pour out his blessings in abundance. In the meantime, before conquering the land promised to Abraham and his descendants, there first came a time of rejoicing over their new-found freedom and abundance:\n\n\"Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, \"Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ''The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord. On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work on it. For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is a sacred assembly, and you shall do no customary work on it\" - Leviticus 23:33-36\n\nSimilarly to Yom Teruah (Rosh Hashanah) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), the Feast of Tabernacles is set apart as a holy day. The Lord repeatedly says that ''no work should be done'' on this day, a merciful reminder that He took them out of Egypt to give them rest:\n\n\"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days. You shall keep it as a feast to the Lord for seven days in the year. It shall be a statute forever in your generations. You shall celebrate it in the seventh month. You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths, that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.'' - Leviticus 23:40-43\n\nIn scripture, there are four plants known in Hebrew as Arba'at HaMinim (the four species), which represent the oneness of Israel and the harvest:\n\n\"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.\" - Leviticus 23:40\n\nThe three myrtle twigs and the two willows are tied together to the palm branch, creating a long and beautiful bouquet called 'lulav', which is waved north, south, east, and west as a blessing is recited to praise the God of the heavens and the entire earth.Each of the four species relates to a particular organ through which man is to serve God:\n\nAt the sukkah table, you will see the four different species that were carefully selected at the 'Shuk Araba'at Haminim\" — the four species market.\n\nYeshua also celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem, where he sat at the temple and taught the people:\n\n\"On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.” By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.\" - John 7:37-39\n\nWhy was Yeshua teaching about living water? Because of Simchat Beit Hashoeva, which means 'Rejoicing of the Water-Drawing House'.At the time, it was believed that Sukkot was the time of year in which God judges the world for rainfall. Therefore they would draw water from the pool of Siloam and enter through the Water Gate in a great and joyous procession, accompanied by the sound of the shofar, and then they would pour the water so that it flowed over the altar.Yeshua was opening the eyes of the people to the eternal source of living water, one that they would taste from and never be thirsty again — inviting them to be satisfied in Him (John 4:4-19).Sukkot is more than a time of thanking God for the miracles He performed in the past, but an invitation to accept Yeshua and the abundance of living water that flows from Him — giving life to all thirsty, wandering in the desert, searching for relief.\n\nGod's great love set the people of Israel free from slavery and brought them to a resting place so they could enjoy fellowship with Him, enjoying all the great blessings and abundance.However, the feast of Sukkot was not just for the people of Israel. It was also extended to the rest of the gentile nations.\n\n\"Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, and to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.״ - Zechariah 14:16\n\nJust as we praise God for His creation, so God wants all the praises of His creation. For that reason, during the Feast of Tabernacles, many believing gentiles from the nations came to Jerusalem and praised the God of Israel. During this joyous time of the year, we pray that you and your loved ones would be set free from your spiritual 'Egypt' and be brought into a place of safety — filled with great abundance, provision, and the providence of the Almighty God of Israel.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Let's explore its origins in the book of Leviticus.</p><p>When God took the people of Israel out of Egypt, they wandered the desert and lived in tents for forty years before finally entering the promised land.<br/><br/>But God desired to give them a home, a safe place where he could pour out his blessings in abundance. In the meantime, before conquering the land promised to Abraham and his descendants, there first came a time of rejoicing over their new-found freedom and abundance:</p><p><em>\"Then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, \"Speak to the children of Israel, saying: ''The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days to the Lord. On the first day there shall be a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work on it. For seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation, and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. It is a sacred assembly, and you shall do no customary work on it\" - </em>Leviticus 23:33-36</p><p>Similarly to Yom Teruah (Rosh Hashanah) and Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), the Feast of Tabernacles is set apart as a holy day. The Lord repeatedly says that ''no work should be done'' on this day, a merciful reminder that He took them out of Egypt to give them rest:</p><p><em>\"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days. You shall keep it as a feast to the Lord for seven days in the year. It shall be a statute forever in your generations. You shall celebrate it in the seventh month. You shall dwell in booths for seven days. All who are native Israelites shall dwell in booths, that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel dwell in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.'' - </em>Leviticus 23:40-43</p><p>In scripture, there are four plants known in Hebrew as <em>Arba'at HaMinim</em> (the four species), which represent the oneness of Israel and the harvest:</p><p><em>\"And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, the boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days.\" - Leviticus 23:40</em></p><p>The three myrtle twigs and the two willows are tied together to the palm branch, creating a long and beautiful bouquet called 'lulav', which is waved north, south, east, and west as a blessing is recited to praise the God of the heavens and the entire earth.<br/><br/>Each of the four species relates to a particular organ through which man is to serve God:<br/></p><p>At the sukkah table, you will see the four different species that were carefully selected at the 'Shuk Araba'at Haminim\" — the four species market.</p><p>Yeshua also celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem, where he sat at the temple and taught the people:</p><p><em>\"On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, “Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.” By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive. Up to that time the Spirit had not been given, since Jesus had not yet been glorified.\" - John 7:37-39</em></p><p>Why was Yeshua teaching about living water? Because of Simchat Beit Hashoeva, which means '<em>Rejoicing of the Water-Drawing House'.</em><br/><br/>At the time, it was believed that Sukkot was the time of year in which God judges the world for rainfall. Therefore they would draw water from the pool of Siloam and enter through the Water Gate in a great and joyous procession, accompanied by the sound of the shofar, and then they would pour the water so that it flowed over the altar.<br/><br/>Yeshua was opening the eyes of the people to the eternal source of living water, one that they would taste from and never be thirsty again — inviting them to be satisfied in Him (John 4:4-19).<br/><br/>Sukkot is more than a time of thanking God for the miracles He performed in the past, but an invitation to accept Yeshua and the abundance of living water that flows from Him — giving life to all thirsty, wandering in the desert, searching for relief.</p><p>God's great love set the people of Israel free from slavery and brought them to a resting place so they could enjoy fellowship with Him, enjoying all the great blessings and abundance.<br/><br/>However, the feast of Sukkot was not just for the people of Israel. It was also extended to the rest of the gentile nations. </p><p><em>\"Then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the LORD Almighty, and to celebrate the Festival of Tabernacles.״ - Zechariah 14:16</em></p><p>Just as we praise God for His creation, so God wants all the praises of His creation. For that reason, during the Feast of Tabernacles, many believing gentiles from the nations came to Jerusalem and praised the God of Israel. <br/><br/>During this joyous time of the year, we pray that you and your loved ones would be set free from your spiritual 'Egypt' and be brought into a place of safety — filled with great abundance, provision, and the providence of the Almighty God of Israel. </p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

And now more than ever, trauma is running rampant throughout the nation of Israel since the horrific terrors of October 7th, 2023. Israelis are in desperate need of God’s healing, true peace, and restoration.VFI recognizes how these terrorists have caused great destruction and trauma in the lives of many. Therefore, we see great value in coming alongside Israelis who are battling trauma to help them rebuild their lives. One precious Israeli that we have been able to support is a woman named Re’ut*. She has received help from the welfare department for several months, along with rehabilitation through the National Insurance Institute.From a young age, Re’ut was exposed to terrorist attacks and horrific trauma. She grew up in Kiryat Arba, near Hebron, a Jewish settlement in the middle of Judea and Samaria. This small Jewish town is completely surrounded by Arab villages. Therefore, the Jewish communities living there have faced the reality and fear of terror attacks daily.As a little girl, Re’ut experienced terrorists attempting to break into her home several times. Can you imagine the amount of fear that puts into a little girl’s heart? Sadly, much worse things happened to Re’ut. One horrific trauma that Re’ut experienced was being raped by several Arabs. She managed to run away from them, but could not run away from the trauma that scarred her innocent heart and body. Re’ut didn’t let this trauma keep her from living her life. She got married and had kids, but she couldn’t run from the pain, hurt, and trauma. She was recognized as a victim of hostility with post-traumatic stress disorder. When October 7th happened, her husband got called to serve in the army, and she lost a baby in pregnancy. Her mental state became even more unstable and her anxiety increased, which also affected her entire family.Due to all of this, Re’ut, who is a graphic designer, has not been able to work for two years. Her husband has been working hard to provide for their financial needs, taking care of the home, and trying to support his wife in the best way he knows including escorting her every time she leaves and enters the settlement.Re'ut is currently in rehabilitation where she is focusing on the occupational aspect. VFI desired to help Re’ut get back on her feet and gave her a laptop so she could go back to work from home as a graphic designer. Being able to work remotely on something she enjoys could help her heal, overcome some of her anxiety, and help improve her family’s financial situation.After Re’ut received the laptop, she wrote us a beautiful letter of gratitude. She wrote:\n\nHow does one begin to say thank you when there are no words that could truly express it? During these days, when the whole nation of Israel is dealing with, and also us personally, severe terror attacks, my husband being drafted, the loss of a pregnancy, and the post-trauma, I came to a state of collapse.But what kept me going is the saying \"Wherever there is destruction there will be expansion\". The Arabs wanted to destroy us and I chose to expand my heart, despite the difficulty.But it's impossible to do this alone. Your help gave me the strength and the light within the darkness. Thanks to you I will be able to rise up from the trouble, and not just me, but also my children and my family. You have rescued me from a mental breakdown, and God forbid, suicide. My heart says thank you, thank you, thank you. You have been the messengers to be my light.From young to old, the people of Israel are battling through trauma right now on many different levels.

We chose Hanukkah to celebrate bar and bat mitzvah with these sweet children from terror victim families because what better time to shine a light through the darkness?Their families have been through so much in their lives, and despite the restrictions of Covid-19, we didn’t give up. We were determined to do everything to give them a wonderful day of joyous and moving activity—even in the shadow of Covid.The celebration of Bar/Bat Mitzvah is a huge milestone for Jewish children, and each child deserves to celebrate this event and feel the special meaning of the coming-of-age of Mitzvot.Sadly, not every family can give their child a festive and honorable event. Such is commonly the case with terror victim families—who are often in deep pain, amid a long and difficult rehabilitation process, and suffering from financial distress.Each year, we at Vision for Israel organize a moving, meaningful, and unforgettable event. This year, 45 boys and girls came to the Millennium Center for a fun-filled day that included a theatrical guided tour.The guests were divided into 4 small groups, with a space in the building dedicated to each group—maintaining social distance from the other groups. Entertainment was provided by Hamizvada (The Suitcase) Theatrical Tours, who performed for each group.The actors came with a suitcase, where they have all the equipment and costumes for the show. Each one of the actors presented something special from a specific era in the Jewish people’s history in Israel.As the event came to an end, each child was called forth to receive gifts before going home. Each child received useful, high-quality gifts, including a Teffilin set, Siddur (prayer book), candlesticks, and more. The excitement peaked as each child received an iPad.The success of each event we organize is measured by one thing—what each person takes with him/her from the event and carries in their memory. All of this would not be possible without your incredible support! Because of you, we were able to lift their spirits and give them an embrace from afar, so they know they are not alone.On behalf of the children, we say Thank you!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nWe all experience hardships from time to time. The Lord challenges us all in unique ways, and sometimes we must endure suffering as we walk daily with Him. Though some pain is normal in this life, certain individuals and families are subjected to horrors that no human being should ever have to suffer through. Terror is not a challenge from God, but rather an abomination of man.A horrific event is what happened to Yo’el* and his family. He, his wife, and his son endured unthinkable trauma at the hands of others, and the experience will never leave them.A few years ago, a terrorist attacked Yo'el while he and his wife were at a playground with their son. The terrorist intended to murder him and his family. Though the murderer was unsuccessful, he managed to slice Yo’el’s stomach open with a knife. As Yo’el lay on the ground, his entrails spilling from his body, he was forced to watch his body crumble before him. Like a farm animal led to slaughter, Yo’el felt as though he was powerless to fight the intruder who aimed to take his life and his family away from him. As he quickly lost blood and energy, Yo’el began to think that his time on earth was coming to a close. His son huddled in the corner, crying out of fear of what was in front of him.Yo’el’s wife, however, did not lose her fight so quickly. Taking a branch from a tree, she began to beat the intruder who was trying to rip her family apart. Even as the terrorist cut her arm and hand, she continued to fight for her family, despite the terror that was unfolding in front of her. Where did this woman find the strength to fight a murderer? In moments like these, God gives us the strength to fight. Yo’el’s wife had no time for fear or intimidation but rather drew on God to act quickly. Her faith in God saved her and her family in a time of unthinkable crisis. Though we would like to think that this is not the world we live in, the truth is that our world is full of fear. Physical and spiritual terrorism happens every day, every hour, and we all wake up each morning to face it. That simple truth, knowing that the world is full of terror and fear, is a challenge to the spirit. When you see it firsthand, as Yo’el did, it can be hard to carry on. Many victims of terror internalize their fear, and it ruminates into trauma that can ruin the rest of their lives. This trauma breaks apart families, ruins futures, and can even fracture faith in God. Vision for Israel is building a core group of special instructors in the arts to reach out to people who suffer from post-traumatic syndrome disorder. The goal is to give them counseling sessions and rehabilitation workshops to help them recover and re-enter society. These programs provide the hope necessary to bring the survivors healing in their wounded hearts and minds. With the help of the program, they will have the tools they need to overcome their daily challenges. The cost for an individual counseling session is $75 per person. Each person will need about 10 sessions, which comes to $750. Our goal is to provide this vital recovery therapy for a minimum of 40 people.Thanks to partners like you, we are able to provide these life-saving programs. Your generosity and compassion enable tremendous change and growth in these dear people. You provide music, art, and counseling rehabilitation to those who need it most, and there is truly nothing more impactful for their quality of life.Your power to help is incredible—and the impact of these workshops and programs is ongoing; the more donations we receive, the more impact we can have. If God is calling you to this cause, we ask that you make an ongoing charitable donation today.May the Lord bless and keep you.Blessings,Batya and Barry Segal\n\n*Name has been changed\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

His son huddled in the corner, crying out of fear of what was in front of him.<br/><br/>Yo’el’s wife, however, did not lose her fight so quickly. Taking a branch from a tree, she began to beat the intruder who was trying to rip her family apart. Even as the terrorist cut her arm and hand, she continued to fight for her family, despite the terror that was unfolding in front of her. <br/><br/>Where did this woman find the strength to fight a murderer? In moments like these, God gives us the strength to fight. Yo’el’s wife had no time for fear or intimidation but rather drew on God to act quickly. Her faith in God saved her and her family in a time of unthinkable crisis. <br/><br/>Though we would like to think that this is not the world we live in, the truth is that our world is full of fear. Physical and spiritual terrorism happens every day, every hour, and we all wake up each morning to face it. That simple truth, knowing that the world is full of terror and fear, is a challenge to the spirit. When you see it firsthand, as Yo’el did, it can be hard to carry on. Many victims of terror internalize their fear, and it ruminates into trauma that can ruin the rest of their lives. This trauma breaks apart families, ruins futures, and can even fracture faith in God. <br/><br/></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nEveryone in Israel remembers the deadly attack in south Mt. Hebron in the Adora settlement in 2002. Two terrorists infiltrated the settlement on a Saturday morning, dressed in IDF uniforms and armed with M-16 rifles, and killed four people.We met Shiri Shefi at the Bar Mitzvah celebration we hosted at the Millennium Center in December 2020, when her son was celebrating his Bar Mitzvah.Shiri Shefi who was then a 27-year-old mother of three small children ages 5, 4, and 14 months, lost her eldest daughter, Daniel. She now recounts the moments of horror and says; “To this day, even 19 years later, I sense Daniel everywhere. In the difficult moments, when everything closes in, I feel her hovering over me and pulling me out. Then I [thank God] for both the good and the bad. There is strength at the end of the day, even though the pain cannot be erased.”“Daniel wanted to go to the synagogue with my husband. A month and a half earlier she celebrated her fifth birthday. I remember that because she wore the same clothes to go to the synagogue, I still remember her telling me, “Mom, just a minute”, as she just wanted to finish watching some kids’ show on TV. And as she was saying those words, I saw a man in my living room wearing IDF uniform with a long M16 and a bulletproof vest, standing at the door and starting to shoot. I yelled at him; “what are you doing?!!” and for a moment I didn’t realize what was happening since we had soldiers in our settlement and I hadn’t yet realized this was an attack. He started shooting and from that moment I acted automatically. I went into the adjacent kids’ room, shut the blinders, switched off the TV, shut the door, and hid Daniel and Eliad under the bed, and asked them to be silent, and with my little son Uriel, I went under the other bed. After a few moments, I turned to the children to see what was happening. I saw that Daniel and Eliad were injured, I did not understand what was happening with them. Everything happened in a matter of seconds and all that while I’m hearing rifle shots continuing inside the house.”In those moments Shiri still did not know Daniel was gone, despite whispering to them to check if everything was okay with no answer. She thought they did not answer because she had told them to be quiet. At some point, when the firing subsided, Shiri started thinking about how to alert that they suffered an armed attack.“As I was thinking how to get to my cell phone I heard Daniel’s last breaths and I realized that she is not among the living anymore. As if God was telling me that I cannot touch her as she is no longer mine”, she says. “I quietly called Eliad again and he did not reply and I thought that they are both not alive anymore and that it’s just me and Uriel.”Shiri managed to get to the MIRS device, and at that moment a neighbor from an adjacent settlement called and asked if everything was ok, in reply Shiri said: “The kids are dead.”“I recall telling the neighbor that if God wasn’t there to help, how could she do anything to help?”The call was cut off and Shiri tried to call the police station in Hebron where her husband, both her brothers and brother in law worked. “I spoke to the diarist and yelled to him that the children are dead.” He did not understand what I was talking about because the news about terrorists had not reached them yet. My brother who was there grabbed the phone and told me enforcement was on the way, and I replied that the children were already dead.”When police forces arrived at the scene together with Yaakov, Shiri's husband, a cry came out of Shiri’s throat: “I'm sorry I could not save the children; Daniel and Eliad are dead.”“Eliad survived,” Shiri says. “When I was in the ambulance they brought him to me to see that he was alive. He was injured in the ear and head but thank God he was alive.”“We had two more children later, Noya and Guy. It was difficult looking for a home to live in. Eventually, after several attempts, we decided to live in front of the sea in Ashkelon, after trying dozens of apartments. We are like the sea—sometimes calm and quiet and sometimes raging. What goes on with our emotions is very difficult because something was taken from our soul, which will always be missed and always be painful—it cannot be explained.” “At the end of the day, with all the pain involved we have no other country,” Shiri says. “When Daniel was born we added the name Bat-El to her name. She is named after my late father-in-law which I never got to know, so we added the name Bat-El to hers. After she died, we wrote on the tombstone: \"A land flowing with milk and honey.\" Honey (דבש Dvash in Hebrew) is an acronym for Daniel, Bat-El, and Shefi.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Partners and Friends,We are filled with gratitude and joy as we celebrate two significant milestones this year: Barry's 70th birthday and Vision for Israel's 30th anniversary! These are not just numbers; they represent decades of unwavering commitment to serving the people of Israel and standing firm in faith and love.As we reflect on these incredible years, one project stands out as particularly close to Barry's heart: the donation of safety shelters. Over the past three years, Vision for Israel has donated close to 300 safety shelters. Barry has personally been present at most installations, driven by his passion to protect and provide for our brothers and sisters in need.However, the need remains urgent and immense. With the current tensions in the north with Hezbollah and the ongoing war in Gaza, the threat to our communities is ever-present. Families live in constant fear, not knowing when the next attack might come. The reality is harsh, but our faith in God’s provision and protection is unshakable.Barry is determined to increase our efforts, with a goal to donate at least 500 more safety shelters. The cost of each shelter is now $14,000, reflecting rising prices, but the safety and peace they provide are priceless. These shelters serve as literal havens of refuge during attacks, offering families a sense of security amid chaos.Your support is more critical than ever. By contributing to this vital project, you become a beacon of hope and protection for countless families. Imagine the impact of your generosity: a mother holding her child tightly in a safe place, a father breathing a sigh of relief knowing his family is secure, and children playing with an increased sense of safety, amid the constant shadow of fear.We invite you to stand with us in this mission. Your donation, no matter the size, makes a tangible difference. Together, we can provide these essential shelters and show the love of Messiah through our actions.Will you help us reach our goal of 500 additional shelters? Your partnership can transform lives and demonstrate God's unwavering love and protection.Please click here and designate your donation to \"Medical & Disater Relief\" today.As we celebrate Barry’s 70th birthday and Vision for Israel’s 30 years of service, let us remember the words of Psalm 18:2. God is our fortress and deliverer, and through Him, we can offer safety and hope to those in need.Thank you for your continued support and prayers. Together, we can make a profound difference.Shalom and blessings,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear friends,As we celebrate the American Thanksgiving and holiday season, it’s a good time to reflect on the sentiment and ultimate purpose behind this time of year. Though many people become distracted by material items and holiday gatherings, it’s essential to focus on the real reason for these holidays: appreciating and honoring the gifts that God has given us.\n\nWorship and praise belongs to God for the wonders and miracles He has done in our lives. Even when we feel distracted, downtrodden, or hopeless, we must focus on being grateful for His gifts. As many of us know, God’s gifts often come in the form of personal challenges.There is a saying in Hebrew—“No one is as wise as someone who has gained experience.” Indeed, at a certain age those who walk by faith gain a lot of experience and trust in the Lord. Some of our challenges are tests of growth to bring us to another level of faith and closer to God. Each time, we discover how great God is and how faithful He is. Each challenge is also a leap of faith, moving us forward for a higher blessing.Indeed, the story of my (Batya) personal miracle began in 2004 when we were preparing for a very big event for VFI in Houston, Texas. When I arrived back in Israel, after some medical tests, I was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor. It was then that I entered into a long period of healing.How could this happen to me? I'm healthy—how is it possible that a tumor had been growing in my body? I could not find any reason. I went through a period of confusion, grief, anger, and sadness, as I continued to ask questions, “Why me? Show me what do I need to change in my life Lord?”Eventually, the questions became prayers and thanksgiving to the God who keeps me. I knew God was faithful and that He would help me overcome and be healed. As I refocused my mind and faith, I rediscovered that He was giving me the wisdom to take care of my body and spiritual walk, building my immune system and strengthening me every day. I remembered the prayer I had prayed as a little girl. The first words that came out of my mouth when I woke were the blessing \"I thank you, living and existing King, for returning my soul to me.” I knew that this was the key to the healing process.As I turned to God, I rid my body and mind of the real toxins: the poison of worry, bitterness, and self-pity. Healing and cleansing of my spirit, soul, and body were through thanksgiving, worship, and prayer.The victory was the restoration of my body and the defeat of the cancer. Today, 18 years later, I can continue to proclaim the wonders I have seen, praising God and thanking Him for what He has done.\n\nMany of you may know the song “Hodu La’Adonai Ki Tov” (Give Thanks to the Lord for He is Good). The Lord gave me the melody for this song when I just came to faith. Today, when I hear believers sing this song in many languages, I am so grateful to hear the testimonies of those people who were healed and blessed thanking the Lord through this song.You can have a listen here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXkO24MiWZwWith experience comes wisdom and better knowledge of the many great things we can be thankful for. Surely, you, our dear friends, have your share of the amazing wonders in your own walk of faith. At any time and in any situation, thanksgiving is our true weapon to overcome all the challenges we face. The ultimate prayer to God is recognizing and giving thanks for the gifts He gives us every day, even when those gifts feel like challenges. We must trust that God has a plan because we know from experience that he always does.\n\nWe are praying for you, our dear partners, and giving thanks to you!

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,Yom Kippur — the Day of Atonement — is approaching and as you know it is the holiest day in the Jewish faith. It marks the end of the 10-day period of introspection and repentance that follows Rosh Hashanah.On this occasion, Jews are encouraged to make amends with God and to ask forgiveness for sins committed during the past year. But it is notable that this important holiday is followed by Sukkot.Unlike the somber reflection of Yom Kippur, Sukkot is a joyous holiday. We celebrate the gathering of the harvest and commemorate the 40 years that the people of Israel spent in the desert on their way to the Promised Land. We celebrate the way in which God offered security and protection to the people of Israel during that difficult time. And as we prepare for Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, we cannot forget our many Jewish brothers and sisters who still struggle today. As God protected our ancestors in the desert, we too must offer protection to those in need. By forgiving others and ourselves at the top of the year, we open our hearts to give.“Giving” is the root word of “forgiving.” They are linked. For when you forgive, you set your own will aside and are able to give to a person or cause with an open hand and open heart. It is with that open heart that we ask you to help us in supporting those in need. Vision for Israel was founded on the principles of giving, and we could not help the many families we do without your generosity.

      "content_html": "<p class=\"MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1\" style=\"color:white\">Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War</p><p>Dear Friends,<br/><br/>Yom Kippur — the Day of Atonement — is approaching and as you know it is the holiest day in the Jewish faith. It marks the end of the 10-day period of introspection and repentance that follows Rosh Hashanah.<br/><br/>On this occasion, Jews are encouraged to make amends with God and to ask forgiveness for sins committed during the past year. But it is notable that this important holiday is followed by Sukkot.<br/><br/>Unlike the somber reflection of Yom Kippur, Sukkot is a joyous holiday. We celebrate the gathering of the harvest and commemorate the 40 years that the people of Israel spent in the desert on their way to the Promised Land. <br/><br/>We celebrate the way in which God offered security and protection to the people of Israel during that difficult time. And as we prepare for Sukkot, the Feast of Tabernacles, we cannot forget our many Jewish brothers and sisters who still struggle today. <br/><br/>As God protected our ancestors in the desert, we too must offer protection to those in need. <strong>By forgiving others and ourselves at the top of the year, we open our hearts to give.</strong><br/><br/><strong>“Giving” is the root word of “forgiving.” They are linked. For when you forgive, you set your own will aside and are able to give to a person or cause with an open hand and open heart. <br/></strong><br/>It is with that open heart that we ask you to help us in supporting those in need. </p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nAs we approach Thanksgiving, a cherished season of gratitude in the United States, we invite you to explore the deeper meaning of the Hebrew word for “thank you” – Todah. This simple yet profound word echoes throughout the Bible and holds layers of significance that invite us to reflect, confess, and express gratitude from our hearts. While today, todah is part of everyday Hebrew, rooted in the biblical texts, it has a profound dual meaning – thankfulness and confession – that brings us closer to God’s loving presence in both celebration and humility.\n\nThe Hebrew todah first appears in the Bible in Genesis 29:35. When Leah names her son Judah (Yehudah), she says, “This time I will praise [in Hebrew: odeh, I will thank] the Lord.” She expresses gratitude purely toward God, unburdened by her challenges. In its earliest form, todah was used only in relation to God and His blessings, demonstrating how gratitude flows from the acknowledgment of His hand in our lives.Even more, in Hebrew, the word odeh which is derived from the word todah, and “confession” are closely connected. Odeh is not only a way to say “thank you” but also a confession of sin. We see this in Joshua 7:19 when Joshua calls Achan to “give thanks to God” and confess. This call to thanksgiving is a call to stand humbly before God and admit the truth in His presence.\n\nThen Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the Lord, the God of Israel, and honor [in Hebrew: thanks] him. Tell me what you have done; do not hide it from me.” - Joshua 7:19\n\nThe ancient thanksgiving offering, or zevach todah, was a significant practice in the Temple. As described in Leviticus 7:12-15, it was more than an act of charity or duty; it was a genuine outpouring of thanks. The worshippers who brought these offerings expressed appreciation for God’s provision, acknowledging that every good thing in their lives came from Him. This heartfelt acknowledgment in todah reflects a truth that rings just as powerful today.Rashi, a prominent biblical commentator, shares insight from Psalm 50:14: “Sacrifice thank offerings to God, fulfill your vows to the Most High.” Here, the sacrifice of thanksgiving was an acknowledgment of sins alongside a thank offering, a blend of humility, and honor to God.\n\nWe see the connection to todah continue in the New Testament, where Jesus gives thanks to the Father. Before breaking bread at the Last Supper, He pauses to express gratitude for the provision of God. In Matthew 26:26-27, “Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, ‘Take and eat; this is my body.’ Then he took a cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, ‘Drink from it, all of you.’” Jesus’ thanksgiving points to the fulfillment of the original sacrificial system in His own offering, ultimately reconnecting us with God’s forgiveness, love, and grace.\n\nToday, as we give thanks to the Lord, todah reminds us of the power of humility, gratitude, and truth in our lives. It’s a beautiful word that bridges generations, still commonly used in Israeli life and language today.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIn this difficult time in the economy of the State of Israel, we find ourselves being even more careful not to spend too much at the local grocery store. When our child puts two bags of snacks in the cart, we return one. We ignore the ice cream that beckons us. And we endure the inconvenience of the rush hours in order to take advantage of sales and price reductions.The cost of living affects us all. Save on costs, cut corners, and try to end the month with dignity. But for people living below the poverty line, the right to basic dignity is a dream. Families wait with anxiety for food baskets. They no longer bring their children to the supermarket, so they don't have to explain why they can't have their favorite snack or just any food item they want. Unfortunately, lots of parents go to bed hungry, just so their children don't know the feeling of hunger.Due to the Corona period that paralyzed the economy for two years and more, the war in Ukraine, and critical raw materials that were stuck in distant countries (including China, which is one of the largest producers in the world), Israel suffered a shortage of products. To help the citizens, the government decided to pour money into grants, which in retrospect caused a severe rise in the cost of living in 2023.Here is the consumption data for 2023 according to the Central Bureau of Statistics:The consumer price index increased by 0.5% in February 2023 compared to January 2023 and reached an index level of 102.8 points. The consumer price index excluding housing and energy also rose by 0.5%, each reaching index levels of 102.3 points and 102.6 points respectively. The consumer price index excluding vegetables and fruits rose by 0.3% and reached an index level of 102.8 points.The prices of fuel, electricity, water, and property taxes have increased, which is also causing the prices in the food industry to go up. This coming May, the prices of controlled dairy products will increase by 16%, along with many other companies raising their food prices.An increase here and an increase there is causing the residents of Israel to plead to be heard. These price increases have affected every pocket, and we don't see any significant change on the horizon that could make things easier.\n\nThe harsh reality is that over 530,000 families in Israel live in food insecurity, which is about 976,000 people of whom 665,000 are children. (This is determined by the Labor and Welfare Committee as part of the report of the National Council for Food Security for 2022.) Therefore, the forecast for 2023 is particularly worrying.Statistics indicate that in families of two or more breadwinners, there are approximately 156,000 families that are still suffering from food insecurity. About 40,000 single-parent families live in food insecurity, out of a total of about 118,000 single-parent families. There are about 176,000 families with parents between the ages of 31-45 living in food insecurity.Some populations suffer even more abnormally and rely on the government to provide them with assistance, such as in the ultra-orthodox sector. However, according to established criteria, the food cards will be distributed to families that are already entitled to large discounts in property taxes (criterion who prefers ultra-Orthodox families). Although in the coalition agreement, it was decided that one billion shekels would be allocated annually for food stamps. The \"Calcalist\" newspaper discovered that in the last budget debate, it was agreed that the amount would be reduced to a quarter of a billion shekels for the year 2023 and half a billion shekels in 2024.The National Initiative for Food Security reports that in the years 2022-2023, hundreds of thousands of families are living in severe food insecurity and are only receiving aid and support mainly during the holidays. Tens of thousands of families in Israel fall through the cracks due to the lack of coordination between the various associations. Many families also feel immense shame that prevents them from asking for support.But these donations solve a temporary problem and do not eradicate poverty. One meal fills a hungry stomach until the next meal. We live in a difficult time, but among these frightening numbers, there are also sparks of light and hope. Humanitarian aid and vouchers or food baskets are providing a sense of relief.\n\nAt Vision for Israel, we meet wonderful people who have fallen into a predicament they never dreamed would be their lot. They get up in the morning and don't know if they can get through the day, let alone a whole month. Sometimes the family is in a stable financial situation and the unexpected storms of life such as trauma, illnesses, accidents, and sudden expenses shake their lives. And their situation quickly worsens like a rolling snowball.Ya'ara* is one of these people. We have known her for many years. She is an educated woman with a master's degree and is also a single mother of four children, three of whom have autism.Due to her children's need for constant support at home, she cannot work long hours at the workplace. Therefore, she obtained a teaching certificate and works as a teacher with a meager salary that does not cover the rent and current bills. Although she receives disability benefits, the amount barely covers all the treatments and specific needs of her children.The alimony she receives is very low - 3,600 NIS. This amount is used for food, clothing, hygiene products, and the completion of ongoing expenses. It is not enough to cover all of these things, plus the special treatments that her children need.Due to the cost of living which has recently gotten worse, Ya'ara* suffers from even greater shortages. She lives with her children in a small apartment, avoids turning on the heating in the winter, and is forced to cover herself and her children with coats and blankets inside the house. Due to the high prices, she is forced to carefully measure the number of fruits and vegetables she can buy each week. She makes many calculations in an attempt to feed her children with reasonable food because she is not able to purchase healthy options due to the high costs. Ya'ara* and her children's Shabbat and holiday meals are very modest, and everything is measured to the shekel. Wouldn't it be nice for her to have the ability to simply buy and serve her children generously?Of course, as a single mother of children with special needs, Ya'ara* doesn't have a single moment to herself during the week. When she is not at work, she devotedly cares for her children. Although they are old enough, they are not independent and she has to support them at all hours of the day. Even the fact that she is a hard worker with high education does not help her in her current situation. She works as much as she can, but the money that goes into the bank is not enough even for basic needs.She has no property and is not expected to receive any inheritance. Three of her children will continue to depend on her financially and will continue to need her every day. As the cost of living increases, she struggles more and more to survive. She cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel. It hurts our hearts to see such a dedicated woman fighting for her life and the lives of her children.\n\nVision for Israel had the privilege of supporting Ya'ara over the years in various ways. We donated two laptops, school bags, gift cards for the holidays, and more to her and her family.In 2022, Vision for Israel helped over 5,000 people with donations of electrical appliances, furniture, food baskets, packages with hygiene products, gift cards for purchasing food and clothing, and more. Not a single day goes by, when we don't provide help to families in need. The need is tremendous and unfortunately is growing more and more, especially now.Sadly, families like Ya'ara's are not rare - there are hundreds of thousands like her. It hurts to know that because of a lack of communication or logistics families in Israel are still suffering, even despite the tremendous efforts of non-profits.Vision for Israel is committed to being a help and support to the residents of Israel in difficult times. It is unthinkable that families and children will go to bed hungry, beg for help, or live in malnutrition. Thanks to the generosity of donors, partners, supporters, and volunteers, we can continue helping the hungry residents of our country.Given the dark forecast for 2023, we believe that the heart of generosity, caring for the citizens of Israel, and love for Israel will overcome the difficulties and the lack. When everyone gives the little they have, whether it is giving their time in distributing food baskets, a small donation, or even carrying the food baskets home for those in need - together we lift up their weak hands.We will continue to support the citizens of Israel always.*name has been changed\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nShavuot occurs seven weeks after Passover and follows the counting of the Omer, which is a 49-day period between Passover and the Shavuot holiday. Therefore, Shavuot falls exactly 50 days after the first night of Passover and is traditionally observed on the sixth day of the Jewish month of Sivan. This year Shavuot will begin at sunset on May 16th and will last until sunset the following day.\n\n1. Shavuot\n\nThis is the common name for this holiday; as it is written in the Scriptures:\n\n“Then you will keep the Feast of Shavuot to Adonai your God with a measure of a freewill offering from your hand, which you are to give according to how Adonai your God blesses you.” (Deuteronomy 16:10)\n\n2. Feast of the Harvest - חג הקציר\n\nThe holiday occurs during the harvest period, in the late spring and the beginning of the summer. This is a time when farmers celebrate the harvest of their crops. When the Temple was still in existence, farmers used to bring a special sacrifice to the Temple. This sacrifice, called “The Two Breads”, consisted of bread loaves baked from the first fruits of the wheat harvest, as stated in the Torah. The feast holds an agricultural nature, and thus it is emphasized in the Scriptures.\n\n3. The Feast of First Fruits - חג הביכורים\n\nAccording to the Scriptures, Shavuot is one of the designated times for bringing the first fruits to Jerusalem. The first fruits were chosen from among the seven species that thrived in the land of Israel: \"a land of wheat and barley and vine and fig and pomegranate, a land flowing with milk and honey.\" (Deuteronomy 8: 8)\n\n4. Feast of the Giving of The Torah - חג מתן תורה\n\nThis name for the holiday is based on Talmudic sources, which claim that on the 6th day of the month of Sivan God gave the Torah to the children of Israel by the hand of Moses at Mount Sinai.\n\n5. The Day of Assembly - יום הקהל\n\nThis holiday also commemorates the gathering of the children of Israel in preparation for the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai.\n\n6. The First Fruits of the Wheat Harvest ביכורי קציר חיטים\n\n“Also on the day of the first fruits, when you bring a new grain offering to the Lord at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work.” (Numbers 28:26)\n\n7. The Manifestation of the Holy Spirit - הופעת רוח הקודש\n\n“When the day of Shavuot had come, they were all together in one place. Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And tongues like fire spreading out appeared to them and settled on each one of them. They were all filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh (the Holy Spirit) and began to speak in other tongues as the Ruach enabled them to speak out.” (Acts 2:1-4)\n\nShavuot is observed around the world by listening to the 10 Commandments recited in synagogues and by staying awake through the night to read Scripture, especially the Book of Ruth. It is unclear exactly how the Jewish tradition of reading the book of Ruth on Shavuot developed. However, many believe that it has to do with the season when Shavuot occurs. It is widely speculated that Ruth came to settle in the Land of Israel around the time that the Feast of Shavuot is observed, one reason being that the story takes place during the harvest period. Many Jews also believe that Ruth’s acceptance by the Jewish people is symbolic of the Jewish people's acceptance of the Torah on Mount Sinai.Another reason why we read the book of Ruth during Shavuot is that in the story, Ruth took it upon herself to be united with Naomi and the Jewish people. Many also view the giving of the Spirit on Shavuot as a renewing or restoration of the true Scriptures.\n\nSome particularly notable details in the text are the redemption of the land, concern for the stranger and the widow, strong family ties, feelings of obligation towards relatives, and the issue of marriage to foreign women. However, the common denominator in all of these seemingly unrelated themes is the attribute of loving-kindness. The deeds of the main figures in the Megillah are depicted in detail, with frequent emphasis on the fact that each of them acted with loving-kindness, within the letter of the law.\"Loving kindness\" stands at the center of the Book of Ruth.Naomi cares for her daughter-in-law Ruth, and Ruth cares for her mother-in-law Naomi. In the relationship between Boaz and Ruth, it is also felt that each of them is acting out of loving-kindness to one another. Even linguistically, the importance of kindness in the book of Ruth is prominent. The word \"chesed\" (kindness) appears three times in the Megillah, and each time it is connected with a blessing from God. The trust and bond reflected in the relationship between Ruth and Naomi is a symbol of the love between the Jewish people and the Gentile believers who love and connect to the Jewish people--those who follow the Jewish Messiah and love the God of Israel.Ruth’s character is also a beautiful picture of how the Gentile believers within the Body of Messiah are connected to the Jewish people.The Feast of Shavuot is a time to rejoice over the first fruits that the Lord has produced in our lives. It is also a time to celebrate the incredible love and grace God has given us in choosing to call us His people. We have the Holy Spirit as the ultimate Comforter, and we have a powerful bond--the friendship between Jews and non-Jews.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Shavuot</strong> </p><p>This is the common name for this holiday; as it is written in the Scriptures:</p><p><em>“Then you will keep the Feast of Shavuot to Adonai your God with a measure of a freewill offering from your hand, which you are to give according to how Adonai your God blesses you.” (Deuteronomy 16:10)</em></p><p><strong>2. Feast of the Harvest - חג הקציר</strong></p><p>The holiday occurs during the harvest period, in the late spring and the beginning of the summer. This is a time when farmers celebrate the harvest of their crops. When the Temple was still in existence, farmers used to bring a special sacrifice to the Temple. This sacrifice, called “The Two Breads”, consisted of bread loaves baked from the first fruits of the wheat harvest, as stated in the Torah. The feast holds an agricultural nature, and thus it is emphasized in the Scriptures. </p><p><strong>3. The Feast of First Fruits - חג הביכורים</strong></p><p>According to the Scriptures, Shavuot is one of the designated times for bringing the first fruits to Jerusalem. The first fruits were chosen from among the seven species that thrived in the land of Israel: <em>\"a land of wheat and barley and vine and fig and pomegranate, a land flowing with milk and honey.\" (Deuteronomy 8: 8)</em></p><p><strong>4. Feast of the Giving of The Torah - חג מתן תורה</strong></p><p>This name for the holiday is based on Talmudic sources, which claim that on the 6th day of the month of Sivan God gave the Torah to the children of Israel by the hand of Moses at Mount Sinai.</p><p><strong>5. The Day of Assembly - יום הקהל</strong></p><p>This holiday also commemorates the gathering of the children of Israel in preparation for the giving of the Torah at Mount Sinai.</p><p><strong>6. The First Fruits of the Wheat Harvest ביכורי קציר חיטים</strong></p><p><em>“Also on the day of the first fruits, when you bring a new grain offering to the Lord at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no customary work.” (Numbers 28:26)</em></p><p><strong>7. The Manifestation of the Holy Spirit - הופעת רוח הקודש</strong></p><p><em>“When the day of Shavuot had come, they were all together in one place. Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And tongues like fire spreading out appeared to them and settled on each one of them. They were all filled with the Ruach ha-Kodesh (the Holy Spirit) and began to speak in other tongues as the Ruach enabled them to speak out.” (Acts 2:1-4)</em></p><p>Shavuot is observed around the world by listening to the 10 Commandments recited in synagogues and by staying awake through the night to read Scripture, especially the Book of Ruth. It is unclear exactly how the Jewish tradition of reading the book of Ruth on Shavuot developed. However, many believe that it has to do with the season when Shavuot occurs. It is widely speculated that Ruth came to settle in the Land of Israel around the time that the Feast of Shavuot is observed, one reason being that the story takes place during the harvest period. Many Jews also believe that Ruth’s acceptance by the Jewish people is symbolic of the Jewish people's acceptance of the Torah on Mount Sinai.<br/><br/>Another reason why we read the book of Ruth during Shavuot is that in the story, Ruth took it upon herself to be united with Naomi and the Jewish people. Many also view the giving of the Spirit on Shavuot as a renewing or restoration of the true Scriptures.</p><p>Some particularly notable details in the text are the redemption of the land, concern for the stranger and the widow, strong family ties, feelings of obligation towards relatives, and the issue of marriage to foreign women. However, the common denominator in all of these seemingly unrelated themes is the attribute of loving-kindness. The deeds of the main figures in the Megillah are depicted in detail, with frequent emphasis on the fact that each of them acted with loving-kindness, within the letter of the law.<br/><br/><strong>\"Loving kindness\" stands at the center of the Book of Ruth.</strong><br/><br/>Naomi cares for her daughter-in-law Ruth, and Ruth cares for her mother-in-law Naomi. In the relationship between Boaz and Ruth, it is also felt that each of them is acting out of loving-kindness to one another. Even linguistically, the importance of kindness in the book of Ruth is prominent. The word \"c<em>hesed</em>\" (kindness) appears three times in the Megillah, and each time it is connected with a blessing from God. The trust and bond reflected in the relationship between Ruth and Naomi is a symbol of the love between the Jewish people and the Gentile believers who love and connect to the Jewish people--those who follow the Jewish Messiah and love the God of Israel.<br/><br/><strong>Ruth’s character is also a beautiful picture of how the Gentile believers within the Body of Messiah are connected to the Jewish people.</strong><br/><br/>The Feast of Shavuot is a time to rejoice over the first fruits that the Lord has produced in our lives. It is also a time to celebrate the incredible love and grace God has given us in choosing to call us <strong>His</strong> people. We have the Holy Spirit as the ultimate Comforter, and we have a powerful bond--the friendship between Jews and non-Jews.<br/></p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

Thankfully, she was born and we all celebrated that she entered safely into the world, healthy and sweetTwo days after the celebration of our granddaughter's birth, we received a message from the nursing home where Barry's mother was living. They told us that her breathing was irregular. Only ten minutes later they informed us that she passed away peacefully in her sleep at the age of 95. A strong feeling of great loss took place in our hearts.Everything happened so quickly. In an instant, we went from rejoicing to mourning. God gave a life and God took a life.It reminded me of when I lost my mother 16 years ago. It happened so quickly, and my first thought was that I didn't have time to sit down with her for long conversations to hear all of her wisdom about life. I wished I would have had more time to do things together with her and to tell her how much I appreciate all her hard work, cooking, and providing for us in the best way she could all those years. Indeed, this feeling of not being able to express our heart's appreciation to those who we love so much and who are no longer with us is very burdening. When Derek Prince was on his deathbed he asked us, \"Have I done enough in my life to serve God?\" Barry answered him and said, \"Of course, you did what you could. You traveled the world and taught from the scriptures. Hundreds of thousands of people were blessed by your fruitful teaching.\" Derek replied, \"I feel I didn't do enough\"...\n\nFor none of us lives for himself, and none dies for himself.

Therefore, we are not able to make a report of all our achievements throughout our lifetime. God examines our hearts and sees all of our actions. The cycle of life begins as a newborn baby and continues over the years in the bosom of a family. This stage of life is preparation for starting life on our own as mature and responsible people.

What is your purpose and meaning in this life? Many of us walk around feeling like we missed out on something.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nOut of all other feasts, Passover is the one that perhaps most particularly points to Yeshua (Jesus). To start, this is the feast of Redemption. Yeshua is our redemption. He redeemed us out of a life of bondage to sin and brought us into freedom in Him. Second of all, it was the evening of Passover that Yeshua had His last supper, the Passover Seder, with His disciples and that was the night He was betrayed.\n\nAs we celebrate this holiday and we ready our homes and our hearts for this important feast, we’re also reminded, as always, of the original Passover story—when, after being allowed to leave Egypt, the Israelites were pursued by the Pharaoh’s army until they were trapped at the edge of the Red Sea.\n\nToday, we can still hear the echoes of the fear the Israelites must have felt when they faced their pursuers that day. We can sense it when we read about global unrest; war, famine, pandemics, genocide… unspeakable atrocities going unpunished. There are many who would gladly stoke the cold fires of despair within us—because fear is an excellent tool. But thankfully, we can also recognize that this is not the first time that God’s people have been faced with the threat of destruction. And every time this has happened—from the first Passover through today—God has kept His promise. He has parted the sea for His people. He has led us to prosperity. He has healed us in untold ways. And He will again.\n\nThe story of the Exodus shows us how God redeemed His people from slavery in Egypt and set them free to serve Him. Likewise, we are set free from bondage to sin and death through the sacrificial death of Yeshua on the cross. Like the original Passover in Egypt, it is the sacrifice of the Lamb (Yeshua) that causes the wrath of God to “pass-over” those who have put the blood of the Lamb on the doorposts of their hearts. He delivers us from the bondage of sin, and causes the wrath of God to be put away from us forever.This is the essential message of the gospel itself—that we have atonement through the sacrificial death, burial, and resurrection of Yeshua our Messiah—the great Lamb of God. On the morning of Passover eve, all the leavened food items are burned in a ceremony called “Bi’ur Chametz”. Unleavened food is considered a corrupting influence—a hidden uncleanness that manipulates purer elements and sin. Spiritual leaven is like an evil impulse within us that corrupts and sours our soul. We must put it away from us and sanctify ourselves.\n\nHere, the Apostle Paul is encouraging us to examine ourselves inwardly and get rid of the leaven that we may become a “new lump” clean of the sin of our past. If we look at the Matzah, we see that it’s striped. This is another representation of Yeshua: “By His stripes we were healed” (Isaiah 53:5). And it’s pierced: “They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced” (Zechariah 12:10). The matzah is pure— there is no leaven in it—just as Yeshua’s body was pure and without sin. Friends, for us, these times are unprecedented. But we must remember that none of this is too big for God. While we celebrate this Passover, and soon the resurrection of our Lord, let us throw out the old leaven of doubt and fear—and replace it with the “new lump” of joyful faith in God. We may live in different countries, with different governments, different leaders, and different laws—we serve one God. And our God keeps His promises. May the Lord bless you and keep you. Shalom, and a blessed Passover to you all.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Like the original Passover in Egypt, it is the sacrifice of the Lamb (Yeshua) that causes the wrath of God to “pass-over” those who have put the blood of the Lamb on the doorposts of their hearts. He delivers us from the bondage of sin, and causes the wrath of God to be put away from us forever.<br/><br/><strong>This is the essential message of the gospel itself—that we have atonement through the sacrificial death, burial, and resurrection of Yeshua our Messiah—the great Lamb of God.</strong><br/><br/> On the morning of Passover eve, all the leavened food items are burned in a ceremony called “Bi’ur Chametz”. Unleavened food is considered a corrupting influence—a hidden uncleanness that manipulates purer elements and sin. Spiritual leaven is like an evil impulse within us that corrupts and sours our soul. We must put it away from us and sanctify ourselves. </p><p>Here, the Apostle Paul is encouraging us to examine ourselves inwardly and get rid of the leaven that we may become a “new lump” clean of the sin of our past.<br/><br/> If we look at the Matzah, we see that it’s striped. This is another representation of Yeshua: “By His stripes we were healed” (Isaiah 53:5). And it’s pierced: “They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced” (Zechariah 12:10). The matzah is pure— there is no leaven in it—just as Yeshua’s body was pure and without sin.<br/><br/> Friends, for us, these times are unprecedented. But we must remember that none of this is too big for God. While we celebrate this Passover, and soon the resurrection of our Lord, let us throw out the old leaven of doubt and fear—and replace it with the “new lump” of joyful faith in God. <br/><br/> We may live in different countries, with different governments, different leaders, and different laws—we serve one God. And our God keeps His promises.<br/><br/> May the Lord bless you and keep you. Shalom, and a blessed Passover to you all.</p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nNow more than ever, Israel and the world need to know our God who performs wonders and miracles! The Iron Swords War began on October 7th, and this nation has been battling strong for two months. And the end is not in sight. Can you imagine how tired, weary, and broken the soldiers and people of this nation are? Many are heartbroken and devastated over the loss of their loved ones in this war. The people of Israel desperately need the hand of God to move in their lives and in this nation. Now is the time for Israel to see our God move in power through miracles and wonders!It is the perfect time to ask the Lord for his miracles. Hanukkah is a holiday commemorating the miracles of God. Hanukkah is a time when the Jewish people remember the miracle of God fighting for us against the Syrian Greeks and the miracle of one day’s worth of oil lighting the temple Menorah for eight days. This year the celebration of Hanukkah begins on the evening of Thursday, December 7th, and ends on the evening of Friday, December 15th.\n\nTo make a very long story short, in 167 BC the Syrian Greeks were heavily persecuting the Jews and forcing them to deny the God of Israel. Many Jews succumbed to worshipping the idols of the Greeks. However, God raised Judah the Macabee and a small Jewish army to drive out the enemy from the land of Israel. The faithful remnant who stayed true to God, not only saw God’s miracle-working power in defeating the powerful army in battle but also were able to receive the land and reclaim the Temple in Jerusalem. The word “Hanukkah” means dedication. The holiday was given this name because the Jews in the time of the Maccabees had to re-dedicate the Temple to God after it had been desecrated by the Syrian Greeks with their idols. At the heart of Hanukka stands the story of the jar of oil. According to the story, the Temple’s Menorah needed to be continually lit, however, there was only one jar of oil left that was pure and untouched by the Greeks. This jar of oil would only keep the fire burning for one day, but to their amazement, this one jar of oil burned bright for 8 days! This gave the Jews time to prepare fresh pure oil to continually light the Temple of God. The small Jewish army winning the fierce battle against the Syrian-Greeks, the oil lighting the Menorah for 8 days, and the re-dedication of the Temple to the Lord were extraordinary miracles of God! Back then, God was showing the Jewish people and the world that when you choose Him above all else and don’t bow down to any other idol, He will move in power to protect, defend, and fight for them.\n\nThe main tradition for this holiday is the lighting of the Hanukkiah, which is similar to the Menorah. The Menorah has 7 branches, while the Hanukkiah has 9 branches. The reason is that each night we light one candle during the eight-day holiday. The 9th candle is called the “Shamash” (attendant or servant) and is used to light the other candles.Each day of Hanukkah, we light one candle on the Hanukkiah. Many families place the Hanukkiah at the entrance to their house or in a window for all to see the light shining bright. As people walk by and see the light, they are reminded of the faithful miracle-working God of Israel!\n\nIt is also part of the Jewish tradition to recite the “Hallel” prayer every day for eight days. This prayer comes from the word of God in Psalms 113-118. Here are a few powerful verses that we can declare over Israel as we are in the midst of a war this Hanukkah:\n\nPsalm 115:9 – O Israel, trust in the Lord; He is their help and their shield.Psalm 116:3-6 – The pains of death surrounded me, And the pangs of Sheol laid hold of me; I found trouble and sorrow. Then I called upon the name of the Lord: “O Lord, I implore You, deliver my soul!” Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; Yes, our God is merciful. The Lord preserves the simple; I was brought low, and He saved me.\n\nPsalm 118:6-7 – The Lord is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? The Lord is for me among those who help me; Therefore I shall see my desire on those who hate me.Psalm 118:15 – The voice of rejoicing and salvation Is in the tents of the righteous; The right hand of the Lord does valiantly.Psalm 118:28 – You are my God, and I will praise You; You are my God, I will exalt You.\n\nAnother fun tradition is the dreidel game. Everyone spins the dreidel, which is a game piece with 4 sides and a handle to spin. In Israel, each side has a Hebrew letter on it (Nun, Gimmel, Heh, and Peh). These letters represent the phrase ‘Nes Gadol Hayah Po’, which means ‘a great miracle happened here.’ In dreidels outside of Israel, the Hebrew letter Peh is replaced with Shin, making the phrase “Nes Gadol Hayah Sham” or ‘a great miracle happened there.’ This game is simple for kids and adults and is a fun reminder of God’s great miracles. Buy a dreidel, look up the simple rules, and play this game with your kids and family this Hanukkah!\n\nSince the miracle of the oil is a focal point of this Jewish holiday, the Jewish people have made it a tradition to celebrate this holiday with foods fried in oil. Some of the traditional fried foods prepared for this holiday are latkes (potato pancakes) with applesauce and sour cream, and sufganiyot (Israeli jelly-filled donuts). There are other variations of fried foods according to the different regions in the world where the Jewish people have lived.\n\nInterestingly enough, the only mention of Hanukkah in the Bible is in the New Testament. It says in John 10:22-24:\n\n“Then came the Festival of Dedication (That is Hanukkah), at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon’s Colonnade. The Jews who were there gathered around him, saying, ‘How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly.’”\n\nAs Yeshua stood in the Temple courts during Hanukkah, a time when the Jews were remembering God’s miracles of rescuing them from their enemies and giving them oil and light, He declared that He was the Messiah to save them and had already worked miracles among the people. During Hanukkah, God wanted his people to know that Yeshua and the Father are one, and the miracles displayed through the life of Yeshua are from the Father.Just as Yeshua displayed the heart and miracle-working power of His Heavenly Father, we also are called to shine His light and be used by God to do miracles to draw the hearts of people to God.This Hanukkah, as Israel is fighting this long battle of war, let us come before our Heavenly Father who does miracles and wonders and ask Him to move in extraordinary ways to draw the hearts of His people to praise and worship Him above all else!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Today, we reach out to you with stories of courage, loss, and the enduring spirit of our people.Our hearts are heavy with the stories emerging from the recent conflict, especially the harrowing experience of families living near the Gaza border. Consider the story of this family from Kibbutz Nir Oz that faced unimaginable terror on what should have been a joyous occasion — a son's birthday. Instead, they found themselves huddled in a safe room, clinging to each other as the chaos of war raged outside. The mother, in a poignant moment of fear and hope, promised her eldest son that they would celebrate life, despite the looming shadow of death.This family's ordeal is a stark reminder of the broader crisis facing our community. With one in every four kibbutz members either kidnapped or murdered, nearly no family from Nir Oz emerged unscathed from this tragedy. Their homes, once filled with laughter and love, now stand empty or destroyed, awaiting the return of their owners.These events also bring into sharp focus the plight of Israel's reserve soldiers, some of whom are also small business owners. Drafted following the massacre, they have been serving our country for months, causing their businesses to suffer significant financial losses. The economic impact on their families is profound and multifaceted, adding to the burden of the ongoing conflict.As we contemplate the \"day after\" — when families return to their homes — we are confronted with a sobering reality. The government is currently supporting 126,000 evacuees in hotels across Israel. However, the question of what happens upon their return to their homes looms large. Many of these families are unemployed, with no source of income, facing the daunting task of rebuilding their lives from the ground up.While the government and insurance companies will take on the reconstruction of the physical structures, the responsibility of refurnishing homes rests on the families themselves. This is where VFI aims to make a significant impact. Our goal is ambitious but vital: to provide 200 families with $10,000 each, aiding them in refurnishing their homes. This support will not only provide them with essential household items but will also serve as a symbol of hope and solidarity in these challenging times.Your contribution to this cause is more than just a donation; it is a lifeline to these families.

Consider how much strength it takes to overcome your pain and protect others from terrorists like the ones who harmed your family. Though these people’s lives are full of pain, difficulty, and sorrow because of terrorists, they persevere to save others from the same fate. The strength of these individuals is immeasurable.As an organization, we support both victims of terrorism and IDF soldiers. It inspires us to hear about victims who find the strength to enlist in the army and fight to thwart terrorist acts. These children of God suffer from post-traumatic stress and face endless rehabilitation challenges, but continue to serve and protect our country.Hadar* is one such outstanding and brave soldier who recently received financial aid from VFI for Passover. In 2016, when she was only 13, Hadar was seriously injured in an act of terrorism. Her family was driving in Har Khevron when a vehicle passed them on the road and opened fire at them.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThis Passover, millions of Jews in Israel and around the world will gather around the table for the Passover Seder. They will read from the Haggadah (telling the story of the Passover), eat a leaven-free meal, partake of the elements on the Passover plate and sing traditional songs. During Passover, most supermarkets and restaurants do not sell any food with yeast, and many Jews clean their houses of leaven.In the Bible, Egypt is mentioned almost seven hundred times and another 25 times in the New Testament, often in connection to the covenant God has with Israel, as written in Leviticus 26:45:\n\n\"But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the Lord.\"\n\nWhy did God repeatedly remind the people of Israel that He delivered them from Egypt? And what is the connection between the Abrahamic covenant and deliverance from slavery?\n\nThere are many reasons for God reminding His people of the covenant he made with their forefathers. Here are a few recurring themes:Because He LovesThe main reason is that God wanted to constantly remind His children of His great love for them. God saw the suffering His people endured under the heavy hand of the Egyptians and decided to put an end to their injustice. He Alone is GodThe people of Israel were easily swayed into serving and following other gods. Through signs and wonders, God proved to them that a man-made idol did not have the power to protect them.Trust Protects the HeartGod constantly reminds them that it was He who brought them out of Egypt so that they would not lose courage in difficult circumstances. Not only did He deliver them in the past, but He would continue to do so always. What does it mean to be in a covenant relationship with God? On the human level, a covenant made between two people can easily be broken – but not so with God. He is a faithful God who kept the covenant He made with Abraham, Issac, and Jacob:\n\n\"But because the Lord loved you and kept the oath which He swore to your forefathers, the Lord brought you out by a mighty hand and redeemed you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.\" - Deuteronomy 7:8\n\nThese verses should be an encouraging reminder in our own lives that God is a faithful redeemer. His reason? Because He loves us.\n\nEven though the people of Israel experienced many miracles, they were still prone to forget His goodness. They might have been free from physical slavery, but a slave mentality controlled their actions. By the time the people of Israel arrived at the desert of Zin, they were all but trusting:\n\n\"In the desert the whole community grumbled against Moses and Aaron. The Israelites said to them, \"If only we had died by the Lord's hand in Egypt! There we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted, but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death.\" Exodus 16:2-4\n\nThe people were discouraged. Their lives in Egypt were hard enough, and now they were faced with an entirely new set of challenges. Was Moses a trustworthy leader? Was God going to abandon them to die in the desert without food and water?God steps in to prove His love and asks them to put their trust in Him in Exodus 16:4-5:\n\n\"Then the Lord said to Moses, \"I will rain down bread from heaven for you. The people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day. In this way I will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions. On the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in, and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days.\"\n\nGod was their provider. He rained manna from heaven and told them to collect double the daily amount before the Sabbath rest. This was an opportunity for trust – an open invitation to rely on Him for their provision.Nevertheless, the people still had a hard time trusting. When they went out to collect manna on the Sabbath day, they found none. God was determined that they would not be controlled by a spirit of fear and scarcity but would rest in his trustworthy character.God used the manna once again as a reminder to the people of Israel for generations to come that He always was and forever will be their provider:\n\nMoses said, “This is what the Lord has commanded: ‘Take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come, so they can see the bread I gave you to eat in the wilderness when I brought you out of Egypt.’” Exodus 16:32\n\nGod uses the Passover lamb (Exodus 12:21) as a precursor to Yeshua, who was destined to give his life for the sins of the world from the beginning of time.When Yeshua celebrated the Passover with his disciples (Mark 14:12), they did not know that soon after, He would become the ultimate sacrifice, shedding his blood on the cross as atonement for our sins.His sacrifice should inspire us to accept the forgiveness He so willingly offers and live pure and holy lives that honor His name.\n\n\"Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.\" 1 Corinthians 5:7\n\nIn Israel today, over 800,000 people live under the poverty line. Most struggle to put food on the table on a day-to-day basis and barely make ends meet, let alone a Passover meal. But God has set in the heart of Vision for Israel to partner with Him in providing food baskets and money vouchers to the needy during the holiday season. Families, single mothers, and the elderly line up with tears of gratitude and words of appreciation for the simple gift of participating in the Passover meal with the rest of Israel. Through the generous hands of donors and partners of Vision for Israel, we are privileged to be a part of fulfilling God's covenant relationship with His people.Just as the people of Israel were encouraged to rely on God for His miraculous provision, many rely on Vision for Israel's help to get them through the holiday season with dignity.This Passover, let us remember again that God has always been faithful to provide for us. Every day He fulfills His covenant with us and offers daily manna in our personal lives as a testimony of love. As we sit around the table to tell the Passover story, let us not only reminisce on the miracles God did in the past but also the miracles of today.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Their son was about to celebrate his Bar Mitzvah. A representative from the venue where the Bar Mitzvah was going to be hosted had called Aaron and said that no food would be served at the event unless he arranged the down payment. They were so surprised to find out that the manager of the venue would be so harsh. So in his despair, Aaron called us to see if we would help him again as we had helped their other son a few years before. Aaron was very embarrassed that he had to contact us again, but he did not want to disappoint his son on his happy day. Sadly, the request had simply not reached us in time.We know Aaron and his family well. They have 5 children. Aaron suffered a severe head injury in a terror attack and lives with PTSD and memory issues as a result. Because of this, he did not remember to follow up with us until very close to his son’s Bar Mitzvah. We knew how difficult it was for them to make it financially and their daily life was a struggle, as Vision for Israel had been supporting the family for the last 8 years. We were happy to fill the gap and provide the funds for the Bar Mitzvah food.We have a long list of families, like Aaron’s, who struggle with similar situations. Families turn to VFI daily for support, and many of them have special requests like this one. They may be facing an unexpected expense when they are already in a dire financial situation or have suffered from an act of terror or violence.We feel responsible for the well-being of these families, and we build lasting connections with them. We want them to know that no matter how hopeless or dark things may seem, we are here to assist if we can. No matter what they are going through, Vision for Israel is a place of love and light for them. There is no shame, no embarrassment, and no judgment when they ask us for help. We are here to provide relief and comfort, knowing that their circumstances do not define who they are.Our Aid to the Poor Fund exists to help families in times of crisis or special circumstances. The money for these acts of kindness comes directly from our partners. Because of this funding, we can provide more complete support for the people of Israel. There are always unpredictable situations in our lives, we are called to be an example for good work. All we have belongs to the Lord and therefore our responsibility is to be wise and hear the needs around us. We strive to be an uplifting and reliable force in the lives of those we help.\n\nAaron and Shula had a good time celebrating the Bar Mitzvah of their second son. Our team at VFI was thrilled to be able to help, all thanks to the special funds we set aside for this kind of situation.\n\nAnd let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart. — Galatians 6:9\n\nWhen you donate, we know that you stand with us in our vision. Your gifts give us strength to give them hope, and together we help them through the crises and upheavals that they face. It is because of donors like you that these miracles can occur.Your support means so much to us! Thank you for your consideration. You may donate here.May the Lord bless and keep you, today and every day.Your friends,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

With God’s help and your faithful support, over 300,000 children have received brand-new orthopedic backpacks from Vision for Israel since we began.Yet the need has only grown.Today, over 1 million Israeli children live in poverty. That’s nearly one in every three children. Many come from large families, recent immigrant households, or homes torn apart by trauma—including terrorism. Their parents are often working multiple jobs and still struggling to make ends meet. And as national defense needs and inflation drive up the cost of living, social welfare support has not kept pace.These children are falling behind before they even step into the classroom.This summer, our goal is to provide 1,000 first-grade children with high-quality, fully equipped backpacks. These bags include essential school supplies—everything a young child needs to start learning with confidence.Each backpack costs just $45. But to a child who has never owned anything new, it’s priceless. It says:You are seen. You are worthy. You are loved.Will you stand with us today and sponsor one—or several—of these precious children?Click here to give a child a new start for just $45 and dedicate your donation to Educational Advancement.We know we cannot erase the hardships these families face. But with your help, we can lift the burden just a little—and fill a young heart with hope.Thank you for walking with us on this journey of compassion and restoration.

Our mission to be the hands and feet of Yeshua in the land of Israel is as crucial and relevant as ever.Even with a possible end in sight, the pandemic that has upended life for all of us is at its most dangerous level yet. The new strain from Britain has proven to be up to six times as communicable as the old strain—although thankfully, there is evidence that the vaccines currently approved for use are still effective against it.But let us remember: the struggle of the poor in Israel, the loneliness and hardship of Holocaust survivors, the mental and spiritual anguish of terror survivors, and the isolation of immigrants and lone soldiers—while heightened by the pandemic—were problematic long before Covid-19, and they will remain incredible challenges for years to come.Like us, we know you are committed to showing the love of Yeshua to the people of Israel, no matter the circumstances. For that we are incredibly thankful, and we count ourselves blessed to be able to work with you.This year, we want to take extra steps to help poor single parents and young couples break their cycle of debt. So we’re enrolling up to 120 households in a special program that consists of 10 one-on-one, in-depth meetings with a qualified financial consultant. When they complete the course, the couple will receive a financial gift of $1000 to start them off strong.Will you help us make their dream a reality? The promise of a fresh start could be the difference between a life of stability—and that of struggle—for a young family in Israel.Thank you again for your faithful support, and the blessing of your friendship as we head into another year together.May the Lord bless and keep you.In His Service,Barry & Batya Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nCaution: This story includes heavy details from a personal testimony of the horrific events on October 7th, 2023.Can you imagine waking up early in the morning to the sounds of shooting and a barrage of rockets? This is what Hezi and thousands of others living in Israel experienced on October 7th, 2023. Hezi is a father of two daughters who lives in the city of Sderot, near the Gaza border. He has 27 years of experience in the security services, was an officer in the Shabash (Israel’s Prison Service), and has suffered from PTSD due to terror attacks. At the end of the Tsuk Eitan operation, Hezi was an officer in the reserves and witnessed a young boy die in a terror attack. That left him with a severe case of PTSD.VFI initially met Hezi through an organization that helps terror victims in Israel. We have supported Hezi and his family for several years, and we are honored to continue to support them and many others amid this war. Despite his struggle with PTSD, this brave father didn’t let it hold him back from defending his nation and his family on that horrific Saturday morning.On a typically peaceful Shabbat morning, Hezi was planning on going for a morning run, when all of a sudden he heard the sounds of intense rocket fire accompanied by a unique sound of shooting. He recognized the sound of the shooting as heavy weapons being fired, and instantly told his brother, “Listen, there are terrorists in Sderot.” Around 7:30 in the morning, he called the army and the southern command, but there was no answer. Hezi explained what he did next, “I called a higher-ranking officer that I really respect. He is a religious person and he usually doesn’t answer the phone on Shabbat. But this time, he did. He thought I was about to talk to him about the rockets, but I told him, ‘What rockets? There are ISIS terrorists here with vehicles.’ He told me, ‘Hezi, maybe because you have PTSD you are still in trauma from the rocket attack. Try to calm down.’”Right away, Hezi took photos of the terrorists outside and sent them to the officer. He also filmed a jeep full of terrorists shooting at an Israeli police vehicle. The same jeep was also shooting in his direction because they saw him in the window. The images the world has seen on TV were a living nightmare and reality for Hezi and thousands of Israelis living near Gaza. When Hezi sent these images to the officer, he quickly understood that there were no forces ready to fight these terrorists. There were only a few police officers in the station, and in the photos, you can see the heroic policemen on the roof of the station fighting for their lives. At this point, Hezi knew he had to help in some way. So the first thing he did was put on the Israeli army uniform that he still had from the reserves. He was no longer a reserve soldier, but he saved his uniform for moments like this. Even though he had his uniform on, he didn’t have a weapon. He was ready to help the IDF soldiers when they arrived, but surprisingly no soldiers came.\n\nInstead, the Magav (Border Police) tactical forces and Sayeret Matkal (General Staff commando unit) officer came and asked Hezi where the terrorists went. Hezi drove with the small team and led them to the police station, where the terrorists went. At one point, Hezi looked at one of the officers, and said, “Friend, I am with you, I just don’t have a weapon”. Hezi explained, “He gave me his gun, and he took his automatic gun. And then I understood at this point that I was joining the fight because there were no forces. There were 30-40 terrorists with no [IDF] forces!”When they arrived at the police station, they saw the police forces of Magav fighting. They managed the fighting, including the infiltration of the building and eliminating the terrorists. All of a sudden, there was a huge explosion that hit Hezi, and he lost consciousness. There was a police officer next to him who was badly injured with shrapnel in his head. They were both taken to Soroka Hospital. Hezi woke up in the hospital. There was a lot of confusion among the staff and the system was overwhelmed. As Hezi lay there in the hospital bed, he could see many soldiers and policemen from different units, all punctured by gunshots. The images of their faces were horrifying. There were little children—terrified by the sights their innocent eyes had to see. The parents were still holding their kids and there was blood everywhere. After seeing how desperate these people looked, Hezi said, “Doctor, why am I here? People need this bed.” The doctor told him that he needed a CT scan of his head. After Hezi received medical treatment, he heard rumors about women and children being kidnapped and taken to Gaza. As he was lying in the hospital bed, he received a message from his youngest daughter (13), who was at Kibbutz Mefalsim with her older sister (16) and mother (Hezi’s ex-wife). The message read: “Abba, I’m scared of being here. There is a shooting here in Kibbutz Mefalsim. There is shooting—Abba, abba. Answer me. I’m scared.”Can you imagine the thoughts running through Hezi’s mind about what could happen to his daughters?As soon as the doctor came back, Hezi asked to leave.The doctor checked him one last time and then released him. Hezi hurried out of the hospital and jumped in the nearest jeep that was full of blood from soldiers who had just come there. As Hezi was driving to the kibbutz, he was horrified by what he saw. Bodies were all over the road to the point that he had to swerve back and forth to avoid running over dead bodies. Hezi recalls, “I drove like crazy to Kibbutz Mefalsim to rescue my daughters. I joined the fighting there too with the soldiers and the local alert force. We fought at the entrance gate of the kibbutz, and then I could enter to reach my girls!”When he finally reached his girls, he saw how terrified they were. They had been hiding in the safe room with their mom for 18 hours. Hezi managed to rescue them and get them out of the kibbutz.As he looked around at Kibbutz Mefalsim, he saw dozens of terrorists on motorcycles shot down by the local alert force and army. Miraculously, the terrorists didn’t get into the homes of the residents. The local alert force and the army unified together to kill the terrorists who were trying to murder and kidnap the people in the kibbutz. There was also a shooting fight at the gate of the kibbutz, where many terrorists tried to enter. Thanks to the bravery of the alert forces, Kibbutz Mefalsim and Hezi’s family were saved.As Hezi rescued his girls from the kibbutz, they grabbed what they could and ran for their lives. The youngest daughter brought her tablet that she received as a Bat Mitzvah gift from VFI a year ago at the annual Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebration. However, in the rush, the tablet fell and broke. After all of this, Hezi contacted us and asked us for some help. His financial situation was hard to begin with, but after the events of October 7th, things got even worse. He asked for 2 tablets, one for each of his daughters, so they could participate in distance learning. They were also in need of basics, like clothing, shoes, and hygienic products. We were able to provide tablets for the girls and also gave Hezi a laptop so he could go back to school, as well as gift cards to help them purchase some basic necessities.\n\nWhen you ask Hezi how he’s doing he answers “...alive on the outside, but dead on the inside.\" He also said, “These sights are haunting me non-stop, and I am suffering from extreme anxiety and long sleepless nights.\" What he and many others have gone through and seen on October 7 is unimaginable. All of these atrocities, horrific memories, and images have shaken him and thousands of others to the core. Let us first pray for them. Pray for God to set his people free from these horrific reoccurring images and trauma that they have gone through during this war. Let us also pray for the hostages that have been released and those still held.A study finds that 84% of Israeli kids, and 40% of parents suffer emotional distress over war.This is the time to take action and show Israel that we are standing with her during this war. Join VFI in meeting the practical needs of Israelis, like Hezi and his family, as we battle through this war!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,Today we are inviting you to be part of a mission of compassion—one that speaks not only to the heart of Vision for Israel but to the very heart of God.As the war in Israel continues, the stories of courage from the frontlines are many. But too often, one story remains untold: the story of the wives of reserve soldiers. These women, the quiet heroines of the home front, carry the enormous weight of uncertainty, emotional stress, and financial pressure—while raising children, holding down jobs, and doing their best to keep life moving forward, day after day.For many of these women, their husbands have been away serving the nation for more than 300 days this past year. Their reality is one of holding the family together—alone. And now, Vision for Israel is stepping forward with a new initiative to serve these women who have so long gone unseen.Take Dalit, for example. Since the beginning of the war, her husband has been called to serve again and again. “When my husband is in a combat zone,” she says, “I can’t really work. I can’t get up, I can’t breathe.” With two small children, no stable income, and constant fear hanging over her home, Dalit’s situation is tragically common. Her son wears his father's army name tag to school. Her daughter doesn't want to leave the house. The economic and emotional toll is devastating.Dalit’s story is not an isolated one. It is a cry from the heart of thousands of women across Israel — women who feel forgotten, who feel that the system has turned a blind eye to their sacrifices. Their resilience is being stretched to the breaking point.And this is where you come in.We are launching a new project to bring tangible support to these brave women. This summer, we will host a special evening at the Millennium Center for 80 to 100 reserve soldiers’ wives. The evening will include a workshop for healing and connection, a shared meal, and an uplifting program of comedy, theater, or teaching. Each woman will also receive a personal gift to remind her: you are seen, you are valued, and you are not alone.Each event costs $18,000—and with your help, we will host many more like it.Your gift today will go directly towards:\n\nThese women serve in silence. But it’s time we raise our voices in their defense. Your donation today will help us meet them in their pain and bring them moments of joy and renewal.Please, will you stand with these brave women? Click here to give your gift today and be part of this sacred mission.With heartfelt gratitude,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friend,The 10/7 terrorist attack by Hamas killed the largest number of Jews in a single day since the Holocaust. Over 1,300 were murdered, over 3,000 wounded, and at least 150 kidnapped and carried into Gaza as hostages. And the horrific attacks on peaceful kibbutzim, sleepy villages – even a music festival dedicated to peace – were everywhere accompanied by atrocities and war crimes. Babies and toddlers were beheaded. Children were slaughtered while parents tried to shield them with their bodies. Terrorists picked up the phones of teenagers and live streamed on the victims' own social media accounts as the whole family was killed one after another. Young women were filmed being marched half-naked and bleeding into their shorts after repeated rapes. Families were burned alive, locked in their homes. A full three generations of one family were carried away at gunpoint. All ages, from grandmothers and Holocaust survivors to children as young as three years old, were taken as hostages and have not been seen since. This had nothing to do with a 'Two State Solution,' Hamas does not believe in one. It wasn't about ending 'occupation,' Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. It was pure evil unleashed \"...to steal, and kill, and destroy.\" (John 10:10)Now, our beautiful nation is united in sorrow. We are weeping. We are mourning. But we are also resolved to defend our homeland and are strong because God is with us. \"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?\" (Romans 8:31)As Israel goes through this terrible trial people all over the world are rallying to help.

Over 1,300 were murdered, over 3,000 wounded, and at least 150 kidnapped and carried into Gaza as hostages. <br/><br/>And the horrific attacks on peaceful kibbutzim, sleepy villages – even a music festival dedicated to peace – were everywhere accompanied by atrocities and war crimes. Babies and toddlers were beheaded. Children were slaughtered while parents tried to shield them with their bodies. Terrorists picked up the phones of teenagers and live streamed on the victims' own social media accounts as the whole family was killed one after another. Young women were filmed being marched half-naked and bleeding into their shorts after repeated rapes. Families were burned alive, locked in their homes. A full three generations of one family were carried away at gunpoint. All ages, from grandmothers and Holocaust survivors to children as young as three years old, were taken as hostages and have not been seen since. <br/><br/>This had nothing to do with a 'Two State Solution,' Hamas does not believe in one. It wasn't about ending 'occupation,' Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. It was pure evil unleashed \"...to steal, and kill, and destroy.\" (John 10:10)<br/><br/>Now, our beautiful nation is united in sorrow. We are weeping. We are mourning. But we are also resolved to defend our homeland and are strong because God is with us. \"What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?\" (Romans 8:31)<br/><br/>As Israel goes through this terrible trial people all over the world are rallying to help.

About half of those who are 75 and older that have been infected with COVID, are also Holocaust survivors.

These brave souls spent their childhood in ghettos, and they are no strangers to isolation. But in their advanced age, being distant from their families, the memories coming back to them bear a striking resemblance. Those who persevere serve as a powerful example to us all.Margarita (95) was born in Ukraine. When the Nazis invaded, she was a youth.

When she was 31, her husband died in an accident.At 70, she made Aliyah with her daughter. But when her daughter died 4 years ago, Margarita was left alone in the world. \"I have no family left anywhere,\" she said with pain. She lives in a public housing apartment in Tel-Aviv, without an elevator. She struggles to go up the stairs, so she has been stuck at home for 4 years. The loneliness is suffocating, and hurts more than anything else.Because of our deep love for people like Margarita, we have dedicated our efforts to providing support—especially in times like these.

We think of courage. And we think of Yehuda.In 2011, Yehuda was just 17 when his life was forever changed. He was sitting with a friend in the Ramot neighborhood of Jerusalem when a terrorist stabbed him in the back and stomach—unprovoked and full of hate. He was rushed to Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital, suffering severe damage to his liver and lungs. And yet, even in those terrifying moments, he remained conscious, fighting for his life.That was over a decade ago. The physical scars remain—but so does the hope.Today Yehuda is in his 30s, married and a father. He went back to school to get a bachelor’s degree in law and become a lawyer. Yehuda was one of the students receiving a scholarship through Vision for Israel’s “Educational Advancement” initiative. These are not just scholarships. They are lifelines. They are the bridge from trauma to healing, from despair to dreams fulfilled.Since 2018, Vision for Israel has stood with survivors like Yehuda. We’ve provided hundreds of scholarships to young men and women who’ve endured the trauma of terrorism. We know that education does more than open doors—it helps restore the soul.Each student receives a scholarship of $430 (1,500 NIS). And this year, in honor of Barry’s birthday on July 15, we’re praying to raise funds to gift 100 students with scholarships—that’s 100 second chances.Will you help us reach that goal?Your support helps these students rise above their pasts, pursue degrees, and begin to build healthy, productive futures. Instead of being trapped by fear, they’re moving forward with courage. Instead of asking “Why me?”, they’re asking “What now?”Every gift matters. Every scholarship you fund becomes a powerful statement: We see you. We believe in you. You are not alone.Please dedicate your donation to “Educational Advancement” and give generously today. Together, we can meet each wounded heart with hope, healing, and a future worth fighting for.Give now toward Educational Advancement.Thank you for standing with Israel’s young survivors.

But for some of Israel’s bravest young men and women, the season brings not warmth—but silence.These are the amazing heroes “lone soldiers” of Israel—many of them not new immigrants, but native-born Israelis who have been abandoned, orphaned, or estranged from their families. They serve in the Israel Defense Forces with no mother to pack their bag, no father at their graduation, and no loved one waiting for them when they step off the bus.Take Shlomi, for example. He grew up in an ultra-Orthodox home as one of 13 siblings. At just 14, he left due to unbearable hardship. He drifted from place to place before ending up in prison and then a rehabilitation center. There, he found a flicker of purpose—and enlisted in the IDF.At his basic training graduation, the loneliness hit hardest. “Almost everyone has family there,” he said. “You’re standing alone, looking right and left, asking yourself: Why?

As we begin the new year, we are challenged to reflect on the recent past, and refocus our minds and hearts on Yeshua for the year to come.These divine words are about hunger in more ways than one. These words are about how we walk through life—about worldliness and knowing and walking with God.They remind us of a simple fact: the truly famished man has not eaten all day long, and as a result, he is ready to eat anything. Even something which others might consider bitter is sweet to him. He will eat it, grateful for anything to help him with his hunger.During the upcoming celebration of Rosh Hashanah, we bless each other to have a sweet year. On our tables, we have honey, dates, apples, pomegranates, and other elements to bless the coming of the New Year. All of these are symbols of the fruitfulness, sweetness, and blessings of the Lord in our lives.Despite the challenges we are all facing in the world right now, and the worries and heavy hearts that can come with them, Rosh Hashanah reminds us to focus on sweetness, in our faith, and in our lives. There are many, of course, who are famished in the literal sense. With the post-Covid economic recovery interrupted by conflict, the threat of terrorism, and a welfare system that has been stretched beyond its limits—we must see this time as an opportunity to address both meanings of hunger for the hurting people of Israel.We know God cares for the poor.

In particular, the following tragedies are all said to have occurred on this very day:\n\nOn the Jewish calendar, 21 days (running from the 17th of Tammuz through the 9th of Av) are set apart to commemorate the three weeks of tragedy that immediately preceded the destruction of the Holy Temple and the exile of the Jewish people from the Promised Land.

During these three weeks, weddings and parties are forbidden according to Jewish law. It is a time for solemn reflection and mourning for Israel. On this 25-hour fast day (sundown to sundown), you cannot bathe, eat, drink, laugh, or adorn yourself. As a mourner you enter the synagogue and take off your shoes; you sit on low stools or the floor. No greetings are exchanged.

On the eve of the fast, it is customary to eat a boiled egg sprinkled with ashes in silence.\n\nOn the Jewish calendar, Tishah B'Av is \"sandwiched\" between the two times Moses received the tablets of the covenant, first during Shavuot and later, after a period of repentance, during Yom Kippur.

At Vision for Israel, we are committed to supporting these brave women as they navigate the path of grief and healing.We are excited to announce a new project specifically designed to bring comfort and hope to terror survivor widows. This initiative will host a series of therapeutic workshops aimed at providing a safe space for these women to heal and connect with others who share their pain.Our pilot event will take place at the Millennium Center and will include 30 women who have lost their husbands in these horrific events. Each workshop will offer a half-day of creative activities, a relaxing brunch, and a thoughtful gift to remind these women that they are not alone and that there is a community that cares deeply about their well-being.Hadas was widowed on October 7 and her story is one of courage and survival. On that fateful day, terrorists stormed her home, forcing her and her husband out at gunpoint. Tragically, Hadas witnessed the murder of her beloved husband. Left with this harrowing memory, she now faces the daunting task of rebuilding her life without him. Our workshop aims to provide widows like Hadas with a few hours of peace and comfort, helping them to find strength amidst sorrow.Another widow, Yasmin, experienced a similar ordeal as she witnessed in terror her partner held at gunpoint, was separated from him, and later he was found dead. The emotional scars are deep, but with your support, we can offer Yasmin a place where she can begin to heal and find solace among others who understand her pain.Our goal is to ensure that these workshops become a regular occurrence, each time welcoming a new group of women who are in desperate need of support and healing. We believe that by providing these therapeutic experiences, we can help these widows find hope and begin to rebuild their lives.But we cannot do this alone. We need your help to make this vision a reality. Your generous donations will enable us to continue offering these vital workshops and extend our support to more women who are suffering. Together, we can be a beacon of hope and love in their darkest hours.Please consider donating today to support this crucial initiative HERE. Your contribution will make a profound difference in the lives of these widows, offering them a chance to heal and find a new purpose.Thank you for your unwavering support and for standing with us as we bring comfort to those in need.

On October 7th, during the brutal Hamas attack on Israel, our civil defense teams - composed of brave citizen volunteers - were the beacon of hope and protection for many. Their swift response averted a greater tragedy, yet it also revealed a stark reality: these teams were under-equipped.In moments of crisis, true heroism shines through. This was vividly demonstrated during the Hamas attack on Israel. Inbal Rabin-Lieberman, the ravshatz (community security coordinator) of Kibbutz Nir Am, heard the ominous drones at the Israel-Gaza border and sprang into action.Amidst a power outage, she wisely prevented the use of generators to keep the kibbutz gate locked. Inbal ran from house to house, rallying the civil defense team, arming them from the kibbutz armory, and positioning them at strategic points along the kibbutz fence. Her quick thinking and leadership were pivotal; the team successfully stopped terrorists at the main gate, preventing a potential tragedy. This act of bravery at Kibbutz Nir Am, situated perilously close to the Gaza Strip, saved many lives.This incident underscores the vital need for well-equipped civil defense teams across Israel. On that day, while courage was abundant, proper equipment was not. Since then, over 700 new defense teams have been established throughout Israel, highlighting the urgency for proper gear and training.Vision for Israel is committed to this crucial cause. In Sderot, donations reached $85,000. VFI is providing hundreds of ballistic helmets and tactical gear sets, costing $975 a set. In the Eshkol Regional Council, extending from Kibbutz Be’eri to Holot Agur, and from Nahal Habesor to the Gaza Strip and Egypt's border, we've identified the urgent need for defibrillators, 2-way radio devices, and scanning lights. The cost of equipping 32 communities in the Eshkol region is approximately $278,000. We recently visited the Druze village of Yanu’ach Jat, mourning its heroes and facing increasing threats. They were in desperate need of our support. VFI supplied them with 40 bulletproof vests, helmets, emergency doctor bags, medic bags, stretchers, and flashlights, totaling around $26,850.\n\nYet, the needs are continuous in Israel, as many more defense teams need this vital equipment. Your support can make a monumental difference. Each donation brings us closer to equipping these brave men and women, ensuring they can respond with the same effectiveness and preparedness as Inbal and her team.Please, click HERE to donate and designate your donation to “Medical & Disaster Relief”. Let us stand together in this noble cause, ensuring our courageous civil defense teams are well-equipped for any crisis.\n\nShalom,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,We want to share with you a story of a woman who touched our hearts deeply—one who reminds us all why we do what we do. Her name is Topaz*, and her life is a testament to the power of redemption, hope, and the incredible strength that can rise from the ashes of despair.Our team met Topaz in Rishon LeTzion, at the welfare office where we were giving out magnetic gift cards for the high holidays to families in need. She shared her story with us—a story filled with pain, yet overflowing with courage and perseverance. Topaz, now 45, once lived a life controlled by addiction, trauma, and brokenness. At just 17, she began using hard drugs after suffering a horrific rape, and her life spiraled downward from there. Her service in the army was cut short, and things only worsened as she found herself working in a brothel, sleeping on the streets, and seeing death up close when a friend she was staying with passed away.For years, Topaz's parents tried to help her, but each time she ran away from rehabilitation centers, too lost in her struggles to accept their help. In 2010, everything changed. After weeks of not eating or showering, a stranger convinced her to go to a rehabilitation center. She had reached rock bottom, and this time, something stirred within her—a glimmer of hope. For a month, she isolated herself from the world, staying in her room and refusing visitors. Sadly, her parents didn’t even come to visit her. They had given up hope, but God had not.In 2011, her eldest daughter was born in a rehabilitation center, and from that moment on, Topaz knew she had to change—for her daughter, for herself. Slowly, she began rebuilding her life. She returned to Rishon LeTzion in 2012, found work, and rented an apartment. Her journey was far from easy, and she faced further challenges, including a painful diagnosis of fibromyalgia. In 2014 she conceived another daughter and although she decided to break up with her fiance at the time, she kept the baby. Topaz has worked for 13 years at an elderly care company, supporting her family as much as her health allows.She is a proud mother of two daughters, and while her struggles continue, she is a woman transformed by her determination to rise above her past. Her eldest daughter is in boarding school, and Topaz remains deeply involved in her education, determined to break the cycle of pain and give her daughters the future they deserve.When we spoke with Topaz, we saw not only a woman who had endured immense suffering, but a woman who had found the strength to heal, to fight, and to overcome. It was your generosity that helped provide her and her family with the gift card that brightened their holiday. Your support does so much more than meet physical needs—it restores dignity, hope, and a future for people like Topaz.Even as the holidays are over now, we ask you to continue standing with us. Your donations help more families like Topaz’s—families who have faced unimaginable hardships but are filled with hope because of the support they receive.Your generosity brings light to the darkest places.

However, in the middle of this month on the 15th day of Av (August 2nd this year), the Jewish people celebrate Tu B’Av — a day of love! What a beautiful picture of God’s love meeting us right amid sadness, loss, and heartache. God’s love restores, rebuilds, and strengthens. Originating from the 2nd century, Tu B’Av was a day for unmarried women in Israel to dress in white and go out to dance in the vineyards as they waited for the men to choose their wives.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,In the early hours of April 14th, a formidable threat emerged from the horizon as Iran launched an unprecedented assault on Israel. With 331 UAVs, drones, ballistic and cruise missiles fired from 1500 kilometers away, our night skies were filled with more than just stars—they bore witness to a potential catastrophe.Yet, as dawn broke, we were met not with devastation but with relief and a profound sense of gratitude. Our advanced defense systems, including the Iron Dome, David's Sling, the Arrow, and the Patriot missile system, alongside valiant efforts from Israeli pilots and crucial support from the USA, the United Kingdom’s Royal Air Force, and Jordan, intercepted 99% of these threats. Miraculously, despite the scale of this aggression, no lives were lost, though one young soul—a 7-year-old Bedouin girl—fights bravely for her life against severe injuries.This incident, while a testament to our resilience, is a stark reminder of the ongoing threats we face. Notably, Hezbollah did not engage in this attack, yet their presence—a proxy terror army funded by Iran with over 150,000 rockets—is a looming danger we cannot ignore.In these moments of trial, we are reminded of these words:\n\n\"That which stood for our ancestors applies to us as well. For it was not only one individual who stood up against us to destroy us. Rather, in every generation they stand up against us to destroy us. But the Holy One, Blessed Be He, redeems us from their hands.\" – Passover Haggadah\n\nToday, as Israel's war cabinet contemplates our response and the world watches, with President Biden convening an urgent G7 meeting, we must not grow complacent. Our preparedness is our protection. Just two weeks ago, I met with the IDF's civil home front command team, who highlighted a dire need for 1,000 additional shelters along our northern borders to safeguard our communities against potential future assaults.This Passover, as we celebrate deliverance and freedom, let us also commit to the safety and security of our people. Nearly 100,000 Israelis have been displaced, their homes under threat from relentless attacks. They deserve to return to a life of safety and peace.We urgently call upon you, our cherished donors and partners, to help us meet this critical need for bomb shelters. Your generosity can shield lives and provide comfort to those who currently reside in the shadow of threat.Please make a heartfelt donation today to aid in installing these vital shelters HERE.As we reflect on the miracles of past and present, let us forge a future secured not only by miracles but by the collective action and unwavering spirit of our global community.For more updates about the war, be sure to visit our VFI News website and YouTube channel.\n\nWith deepest gratitude and hope for peace,Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe Sderot City Development Fund sent VFI a request in December 2023 to help purchase emergency equipment and tactical clothing for their emergency teams. Without hesitation, we began contacting suppliers and were able to purchase the valuable equipment that was needed.Due to the war, high demand, and delays in imports and delivery, we had to wait several months until we were able to receive all the equipment we purchased. The equipment we donated to the forces in the city included:\n\nOnce all the equipment came in and was organized, we set up a delivery date. Barry, Batya, and Liat traveled to Sderot city hall and were welcomed by the Director of Resource Mobilization. Some members of the security forces helped them unload all of the equipment. There was a special ceremony for VFI to present the equipment to the city. We showed them one set of equipment: a headlamp, a scanning light, tactical pants and shirt, tactical gloves, a pair of shoes, a softshell jacket, a helmet, and a medic bag. Many attended the event that day: officials from the Sderot municipality, including the mayor, the director of resource mobilization, the emergency officer and supervisor, and representatives from the emergency squad and police.The mayor, Mr. Alon Davidi, made the initial opening remarks. He talked about the surprise attack on Israel on October 7th. He praised the emergency teams that were called in and the municipal police that immediately responded. They had to leave their families, wives, and children, yet with one goal in mind — to protect and save the lives of the citizens and residents. Alon strengthened them by validating the importance of uprooting the enemy and restoring the residents' sense of security and peace.Alon communicated his appreciation, recognition, and thanks to Vision for Israel for our continual support throughout the years, and especially now during the war. The mayor also expressed his care for the well-being and safety of the residents of Sderot, and that he would go to great lengths to restore peace to the area. Afterward, we heard a personal testimony of October 7th from Ronen, the emergency squad coordinator.“At 6:30 am, on Simchat Torah, Hamas launched a heavy barrage of hundreds of rockets within 10 minutes at the Israeli settlements near Gaza and the city of Sderot.” Ronen received a message that a rocket had hit, and because of his role as emergency squad coordinator, he had to leave everything immediately, pick up the mayor, drop him off at the war room, and then go to the point where the rocket hit.Instead of picking up the mayor first, Ronen decided to go towards the point where the rocket was detected because the rocket alarms were going off every few seconds. After a few moments, the mayor called Ronen and demanded that he turn around to pick him up. Unknowingly, the mayor saved Ronen's life by bringing him back. Apparently, there were terrorists just a few meters away from where Ronen was. By turning around, he missed running into the terrorists in just a few seconds.After Ronen dropped off the mayor in the war room, he immediately returned to the field, gathered the entire emergency squad, and then quickly found himself leading a battle against the terrorists. Ronen was wounded in the shoulder by 2 Kalashnikov bullets and shrapnel in his leg. He explained, “I had crazy adrenaline, and despite the pain, I continued to fight with all my might to defend the homes and residents. All I could do was to save as many lives as I could. It took the army about two hours to arrive so I felt it was my personal duty to fight.”Security officer David added that Ronen even saved the life of a police officer — Ronen was pulling a police officer to safety and treating him while he was injured. It took a while before Ronen was evacuated to the hospital because of the many terrorists, and the many wounded and murdered citizens who needed to be treated. After several hours, Ronen finally received treatment. Thankfully, he is fully functioning today and back in his position to protect the people of Sderot.We heard another testimony from Tal, the Director of Sderot’s Municipal Police Department who manages 14 municipal police inspectors, shared a short testimony.“At 7:00 a.m. while running towards the fall (of a rocket), I received a message that terrorists had infiltrated the police station in the city. We left everything and ran towards the station to help the police.” Tal quickly found himself leading a team to go up against terrorists, while a barrage of rocket fire was flying over their heads. Tal honored the heroic police team that fought face-to-face with the terrorists, while dealing with many different types of ammunition from Hamas terrorists: RPGs, Kalashnikovs, grenades, and more. Tal explained that they were all completely surprised and not ready for a battle of such magnitude. Dor’el, the director of fundraising at the Sderot City Development Fund shared about the long-standing partnership with VFI. He praised Barry and Batya for running an organization that has embraced the city of Sderot for over two decades on various levels: welfare, security, emergency, culture, and more. Dor’el asked the squad members and fighters if they had received emotional or psychological treatment. Many responded that they had received some treatments from time to time. During the whole ceremony, we saw the unbearable pain, worry, and sadness of these men. It wasn’t an easy sight and it saddened us. The ceremony ended with the distribution of the equipment. It was a very meaningful meeting, and we were happy to cooperate with the welfare department of the city of Sderot, which worked in an orderly and efficient manner.After the ceremony, we met with the director of the social services department, his deputy, and Dor’el, to discuss the city’s additional needs as the residents return to their homes. They told us about the damages in their city: 1200 property tax claims, 70 houses completely destroyed, 25 orphans, several widows, many people who lost their businesses or workplaces, and many other unexpected losses and expenses.We talked about possibly establishing a flexible fund in cooperation between the city and Vision for Israel. We were also told that almost 100% of the people in the city have PTSD. There is not a single resident of the city who has not experienced the trauma and harm in one way or another throughout the years, especially during this current war.At the end of the meeting, Dor’el took us on a tour of the police station that was destroyed. He explained what happened there, while neighbors and passersby also told us about their experiences. One resident told us that he witnessed a Hamas sniper climb onto the roof of a residential building and fire at civilians, policemen, and security forces, murdering and causing serious injuries to many. Then he saw a bystander take notice of the Hamas sniper from a distance, climb onto the roof of a different building, and with one shot kill the Hamas sniper, saving many lives.Another resident shared that she saw a Hamas sniper go to the roof of her building. She explained that she and her neighbors trembled with fear when the terrorists knocked on the doors of their houses, and then went up to the rooftops to kill many Israelis. It was deeply touching to meet some of the people from Sderot who lived through the horrors of October 7th. We were amazed to see them returning to their homes again. 85% of the residents have returned to the city, however, our initial feeling was that it felt like a ghost town. The city is now full of painful and horrific memories. The residents have lost their smiles and joy, and many walk with sadness, fear, and anxiety. VFI has stood with the people of Sderot for many years, and we will continue to faithfully support them as they work through trauma, PTSD, and the restoration of their city.We invite you to continue to pray for the people in Sderot and the entire nation of Israel during this difficult time of war. And join us by financially supporting the people of Israel to help meet their needs as the war continues.

      "title": "Victory Over Terror and Loss",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIsrael is no stranger to terror attacks, and unfortunately, many suffer the devastating and life-altering physical and emotional effects of these attacks even decades later.The story of Gloria Riani, a terror attack survivor, is one we wish was never her's to tell.An outstanding woman with a career working at the Hillel Yaffe hospital, a wife and mother to five children — she and her son's lives were turned upside down, never to be the same. When she recalls that horrific day, Gloria cannot hide her helplessness and, in her own words, considers herself a \"broken vessel,\" not just physically but mostly mentally.Fortunately, Vision for Israel has had the immense privilege of providing Gloria and her family with financial aid for the holidays for several years, including the last Passover. Gloria and her 17-year-old son, Doron, were injured in the bloody attack that took place on July 12th, 2005, at the entrance to the Sharon Mall in Netanya, and since then, their lives have become unbearable.It was a hot July day, and Gloria was dealing with the mundaneness of life — trying to change her son Doron's dental appointment unsuccessfully.So they decided to spend the gap in their schedule on a quick trip to the Sharon Mall near their house. Kids were on their summer break, and the mall was crowded with Netanya residents and hundreds of youth ditching the heat for a hangout at the mall.It was then, when Gloria and Doron left the mall on their way to the appointment, that their lives changed forever. Gloria exited first and sat on a nearby bench beside a man as she took a phone call and waited for Doron to follow. From the corner of her eye, Gloria noticed her son, Doron, coming out of the mall as commotion stirred up.\n\n\"I heard shouts and commotion at the entrance to the mall, but I didn't pay much attention to it, and then it was as if the sky had fallen. Suddenly, there was a huge explosion; everything shook, and I was flung back a few meters. I found myself lying on the ground, feeling great pain in my right arm, and lying motionless next to me was the guy who sat down next to me on the bench. I tried to move him — he was dead. At this point, I tried locating Doron. The force of the explosion sent him flying in a different direction altogether. Despite the immediate commotion, I managed to see him calling to me.“\n\nThe attack at the Sharon Mall in Netanya took a heavy toll. The terrorist who blew himself up at the crossing near the shopping center was responsible for the death of four people and the wounding of 94 men and women.Some of the injured were rushed to the hospital in critical condition. Gloria and Doron were rushed to the Laniado hospital in two separate ambulances, but a short time later, Doron was transferred by helicopter to Hillel Yaffe Hospital due to his serious condition. Between operations, Gloria received updates on her son's critical condition, suffering severe injuries to his left leg, liver, lungs, and ears.\n\n\"Just when a mother should be by her son's side, this was prevented from me,\" she said. \"There is nothing more frustrating than lying helpless, knowing that my Doron needs me, now more than ever — and I cannot save him.\"\n\nMany years have passed since then, but for the Riani family, it seems their lives have been frozen in time. Gloria and Doron, who were severely wounded, are still knee-deep in the healing process and daily struggles of that traumatic and bitter day.\"Life has become one big living hell\", says Gloria, \"from a normal and stable family, we have become a family struck by fate, living only to survive another day. We're stuck in a loop as a result of the attack. It feels like riding a non-stop roller coaster that jerks you from side to side, threatening to take down your whole family.\"Not only has the healing process been grievous, but bureaucratic issues with Doron's national health insurance made life difficult and near impossible. While healing and suffering from severe mental damage, he was sent from one medical committee to another and had endless meetings to receive the care he needed. \"I lost a child. Although Doron was not killed in the attack, he is like the living dead. That's the only way I can describe it. We've reached a dead end, and I can't see a single ray of light in the dark\", Gloria adds.Although Gloria and her son were the only ones in the family injured in the attack, the lives of the whole family were permanently altered as well. She stopped working at the hospital and spent most of her time receiving medical treatments and caring for Doron. For the first two-three years after the attack, her husband, Yaakov, a taxi driver, had to run between the two hospitals in addition to taking care of their other four children at home.The medical treatments required for her and Doron have brought the family to a dire state of poverty; she explained: \"We've exhausted and drained our savings... we have been living on advances and loans. Medical treatments and equipment are costly... I would be lying if I said that suicidal thoughts do not arise occasionally. But then I think about the children and Doron and Yaacov, my husband; I know there is someone to fight for.\"\n\nMany people like Gloria and her son Doron barely made itout alive and whose families suffer greatly. Often, their cases get lost in the healthcare system, and this makes them feel like they are fighting to be seen and receive the help they need.It is our mission to support the broken, the injured, and the traumatized and grant them the help they so desperately cry out to receive. Every care package filled with food, every gift card, and social event is like balm to a struggling family.Healing comes in big and small ways; it's in the intentional look of compassion when you look the survivors in the eyes, it's in the gentle hug and smile, and the knowledge that they know that someone sees and cares about their pain.Every year, VFI reaches out to numerous victims of terrorism through various social events and projects. These initiatives include providing care for families and individuals, awarding educational grants to students, offering special support to families in need, facilitating participation in summer camps for orphans, organizing workshops, and providing general aid.If it wasn’t for the support from partners, donors, and friends like you — Gloria, Doron, and her whole family would still wonder whether someone recognizes their pain. It is because of you that they know — we care.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

These holidays and events are part of the heritage of our people and show both the joy and the sorrow of our journey as a people. In Israel, these days are central to our culture and yearly calendar, giving us time to reflect on our lives and deepen our connection with God.Purim is one such holiday. Each year, in late winter, we celebrate the salvation of the Jewish people from Haman. Had we not been, tens of thousands would have been annihilated. Despite the gravity of its origins, Purim is a joyous time full of food, drink, and celebration.During these times of celebration, it’s important to reflect upon how God saved us in the direst circumstances. Many are not as fortunate as we are, and do not have the money, time, or mental capacity to properly celebrate Purim.Here at Vision for Israel, we strive to provide happiness, joy, and celebration for those who have very little. This year, we are hosting a Purim celebration for individuals and families who have survived acts of terror. These people have been through the worst that the world has to offer, and they must live with their pain and loss every day. Many also face situations of poverty and hunger at the same time.We believe that everyone should be able to celebrate Purim. We want to provide joy and positive experiences for those who have lost so much and allow them a respite from their daily pain. The celebration allows for relaxation, rejuvenation, and fun. Our Purim event will include food and drink, gifts, music, workshops, and activities for children and adults alike. Because of COVID-19, we have been unable to host this event for the past two years. We are thrilled to be able to do it this year.However, we can’t run this event without your help. Our Purim celebration costs around $23,000. We believe this is more than worth it for the joy and relief that it brings to these terror survivors, and we need your support to make it happen.Please give generously here so that hundreds of men, women, and children can experience a bit of joy and celebration, despite the horrors they have seen.May God bless and keep you this Purim season.Your friends, Batya and Barry Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe Sabbath (in Hebrew, Shabbat, pronounced shah-BAHT) may be the Jewish people’s most distinctive and characteristic practice, as well as one of its most prevalent and long-lasting gifts to Western civilization.Shabbat begins at sunset on Friday evening and ends at nightfall on Saturday when 3 stars are visible in the sky. Shabbat is more than just a day off from labor. It is also a day of physical and spiritual delights that is meant to illuminate certain key concepts in the traditional Jewish perception of the world.Shabbat is considered to be the most important of Jewish holidays. It's to be marked by three qualities: rest, holiness, and joy.\n\nLike many important facets of Judaism, Shabbat has its origins in the Torah, where it is most notable as a day of complete cessation of labor. On Shabbat, we remember that God created the world in 6 days, and on the seventh day He rested from his labor (Gen. 2:2). The prophetic tradition portrays it as a day of pleasures as well. The Rabbis spelled out their understanding of forbidden “labor” in a complex series of restrictions on productive activities of many sorts. They also prescribed festive meals and ceremonies for every part of the day. The varieties of Shabbat observances and customs over the ages and around the world illustrate the adaptation of Jews in many societies to new realities and modern ideas.\n\nShabbat is portrayed in the Bible as the pinnacle of the creation of the universe, and its observance can be seen as a reminder of the purposefulness of the world and the role of human beings in it. Shabbat also serves as a memorial to God‘s act of rescuing the Israelites from slavery in Egypt by setting aside a day for personal autonomy and freedom from the harsh demands of labor. The traditional Shabbat is portrayed in Jewish liturgy, song, and story as a day of joy, a sanctuary from travails, and even a foretaste of the perfected world that will someday be attained.\n\nShabbat is a time to spend with family and friends, to pray, read the Bible, and rejuvenate. One constant theme in Shabbat's observance across time and territory is the centrality of home life with family members and guests. Preparation for Shabbat begins as early as mid-week in some households, and its arrival is marked by the spiritual illumination of a candle-lighting ceremony.

Shabbat is more than just a day off from labor. It is also a day of physical and spiritual delights that is meant to illuminate certain key concepts in the traditional Jewish perception of the world.<br/><br/><strong>Shabbat is considered to be the most important of Jewish holidays. It's to be marked by three qualities: rest, holiness, and joy.</strong><br/><br/></p><p> Like many important facets of Judaism, Shabbat has its origins in the Torah, where it is most notable as a day of complete cessation of labor. On Shabbat, we remember that God created the world in 6 days, and on the seventh day He rested from his labor (Gen. 2:2). <br/><br/>The prophetic tradition portrays it as a day of pleasures as well. The Rabbis spelled out their understanding of forbidden “labor” in a complex series of restrictions on productive activities of many sorts. They also prescribed festive meals and ceremonies for every part of the day. The varieties of Shabbat observances and customs over the ages and around the world illustrate the adaptation of Jews in many societies to new realities and modern ideas.<br/><br/></p><p>Shabbat is portrayed in the Bible as the pinnacle of the creation of the universe, and its observance can be seen as a reminder of the purposefulness of the world and the role of human beings in it. Shabbat also serves as a memorial to God‘s act of rescuing the Israelites from slavery in Egypt by setting aside a day for personal autonomy and freedom from the harsh demands of labor. <br/><br/> The traditional Shabbat is portrayed in Jewish liturgy, song, and story as a day of joy, a sanctuary from travails, and even a foretaste of the perfected world that will someday be attained.<br/></p><p>Shabbat is a time to spend with family and friends, to pray, read the Bible, and rejuvenate. One constant theme in Shabbat's observance across time and territory is the centrality of home life with family members and guests. Preparation for Shabbat begins as early as mid-week in some households, and its arrival is marked by the spiritual illumination of a candle-lighting ceremony. <br/><br/>Rabbinic tradition mandates three Shabbat meals, two beginning with a special <em>kiddush</em> (“sanctification”) recited over wine.

      "title": "What are the Jewish Fall Holidays?",
      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIn just a few weeks, we’ll be entering the fall season. And with it, the season of high holidays on the Jewish calendar that prophetically indicate the great Day of the Lord, the second coming of Jesus, the great national turning of the Jewish people, and the establishment of the reign of the Messiah over the earth.\n\nTo accompany you on your own faith journey this season, we’ve assembled a brief overview of the upcoming holidays. Feel free to observe along with us, and mark the days with shared solemnity and joy.\n\nIn traditional Judaism, Rosh HaShanah is celebrated as the Jewish New Year. The holiday is observed on the first 2 days of the month of Tishrei. This also marks the beginning of a ten-day period of prayer, self-examination and repentance, known as Ten Day of Awe (Aseret Yemei Teshuvah, Yamim Nora’im), which culminates on the fast day of Yom Kippur. Rosh HaShanah also commemorates the creation of the universe by God.\n\nRosh Hashanah is also called “Yom Teru’ah”, The Feast of Trumpets. Tradition stated that the universe was created by the Lord on Rosh HaShanah.\n\nAnother name for Rosh Hashanah is “Yom Hazikaron”, Day of Remembrance (Lev. 23:24) in reference to the commandment to remember to blow the shofar to coronate God as King of the universe. The blast of the shofar is meant to jolt us from our sleep. We are to remember who we really are, by remembering that God is our King.\n\nAccording to Jewish tradition, on Rosh Hashanah the destiny of the righteous is written in the Book of Life and the destiny of the wicked is written in the Book of Death. However, most people will not be inscribed in either book, but have 10 days – until Yom Kippur – to repent before sealing their fate. Hence the name, Ten Days of Awe.\n\nOn Yom Kippur, everyone’s name will be sealed in one of the books. That is why people greet each other during those days “Le’Shana Tova tichatevu ve’tichatemu” – May your name be written in the book of life.\n\n1. Candle lighting and Kiddush\n\n2. Round Challah loaves – signifying a crown and the Kingship of God. Also representing the cycle of the year.\n\n3. “Simanim”—Special foods that each signify a wish for the new year, used in a special prayer:\n\nApples in honey – as a wish for a sweet new year.\n\nBlack-eyed Peas (Rubiya) - the word Rubiya comes from the word “Rabu”, to increase. “May our merits increase.”\n\nPumpkin (Kara) - Kara means to rip away. “May the evil judgment be ripped away from us and that our rights be read before You.”\n\nLeeks (Karat) - Karat means to cut off. “May those who hate us be cut away.”\n\nBeets (Selek) - Selek comes from the word \"\"Silek\", to drive away. “May our enemies be driven away.”\n\nDates (Tamar) - Tamar comes from the word “Tam”, to be ended. “May those who hate us be ended.”\n\nPomegranate (Rimon) - “May our merits be numerous as the seeds of a pomegranate.”\n\nFish head (Dagim) - “May we be the head and not the tail.”\n\n4. Tashlich (Casting Off) – on Tishrei 1st in the afternoon, many Jews perform the ritual of Tashlich, a ceremony in which we symbolically cast our sins into a body of flowing water. We walk to a creek or a river and empty our pockets into the water, symbolically casting off our sins. Verses are recited during this ceremony.\n\nThe Day of Atonement is the holiest day of the Jewish year and provides prophetic insight regarding the Second Coming of the Messiah, the restoration of national Israel, and the final judgment of the world. It is also a day that reveals the High-Priestly work of Yeshua as our High-Priest.\n\nThe Torah states that Yom Kippur was the only time when the high priest could enter the Holy of Holies and call upon the name of the Lord to offer blood sacrifice for the sins of the people. This “Life for a life” principle is the foundation of the sacrificial system and marked the great day of intercession made by the High Priest on behalf of Israel.\n\nIn traditional Judaism, Yom Kippur marks the climax of the ten-day period of repentance—The Days of Awe. According to the sages on this day each person’s name is written either in the Book of Life or the Book of Death.\n\nYom Kippur begins at nightfall on Tishrei 9th and continues on the 10th for 25 hours. It is a solemn day marked by complete fasting, prayer, and additional synagogue services.\n\nThe root of the word Kippur (Atonement) is kafar (כפר), which derives from the word kofer—ransom. It also means kapara—“redemption”. The great majority of usage in the Bible concern “making an atonement” by the priestly ritual of sprinkling the sacrificial blood to remove sin or defilement.\n\nThe lifeblood of the sacrificial animal was required in exchange for the lifeblood of the worshipper. This symbolism is further clarified by the action of the worshipper in placing his hand on the head of the sacrifice and confessing his sins over the animal, which was then killed or sent as a scapegoat.\n\nThe root also appears in the word kapporet—the Mercy Seat. The kapporet was the golden cover of the sacred chest in the Holy of Holies of the Temple, where the sacrificial blood was presented.\n\nOriginally, Yom Kippur was focused on the role of the high priest and the purification of the Sanctuary, but since the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, Rabbinic tradition states that each Jew is supposed to focus on his personal service of the Lord. Most of the prayers on Yom Kippur, therefore, revolve around the central theme of personal repentance and return.\n\nAccording to Jewish Law (Halacha), we must abstain from five forms of pleasure based on Lev. 23:27:\n\n- Eating and drinking.\n\n- Washing and bathing.\n\n- Applying lotions or perfume.\n\n- Wearing leather shoes.\n\n- Marital relations.\n\nThe fast begins an hour before sundown on Tishrei 9th and lasts 25 hours. A special meal is usually prepared – the last meal before sundown, called Se’udah Mafseket. The meal includes candle-lighting and special blessings are recited.\n\nMost of Yom Kippur is spent at the synagogue, praying and listening to chants. It is essentially the last appeal and chance to change the judgment of God, to demonstrate repentance and make amends.\n\nOn the 15th day of Tishrei, the joyous feast of Sukkot begins and lasts 7 days, immediately followed by Simchat Torah.\n\nDuring this time many Jewish families build a Sukka, a four-legged structure built in haste to remember the huts in which the people of Israel lived in during their 40 years sojourn in the desert. Observant Jews eat all their meals in the Sukka and even sleep in it.\n\nAfter the people of Israel entered the promised land, Sukkot was associated with the fall harvest and came to be known as Chag ha-Asif, the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year. Certain customs were incorporated into the observance of Sukkot, including decorating the Sukka, performing special “wave” ceremonies of the “Four Species”, and others.\n\nWe are commanded to rejoice during the holiday of Sukkot for the blessings of God’s provision and care for our lives (Deut. 16:14-15).\n\nSukkot is the conclusion of the Jewish fall holidays and the last of the three pilgrimage festivals (Passover, Shavu’ot, and Sukkot).\n\nThe word Joy/Rejoice appears several times regarding Sukkot. In ancient Israel, the joy of Sukkot was so great that it became known simply as “the Feast”. Later it was known as Z’man Simchatenu – The Season of Our Joy.\n\nFrom an agricultural perspective in ancient Israel, Sukkot corresponded to the fruit harvest. Total joy would come after all the crops were harvested in the fall, and thereby receive sustenance and provision for the coming year from the Lord. For this reason, Sukkot is also referred to as Hag Ha’Asif – the Feast of Ingathering.\n\nFrom a spiritual perspective, Sukkot corresponds to the joy of knowing your sins were forgiven (during Yom Kippur), and also recalls God’s miraculous provision and care, after the deliverance from bondage in Egypt. Prophetically, Sukkot anticipates the coming kingdom of Yeshua wherein all the nations shall come up to Jerusalem to worship the Lord during the Feast (Zech. 14:16). Today Sukkot is a time to remember God’s sheltering presence and provision for us for the start of the New Year. In light of the work of Yeshua, our High Priest, we now have access to the Heavenly Temple of God.\n\nIn biblical times, Sukkot was considered the most important of all the holidays. It is one of the three required festivals of the Lord.\n\nThe Torah explicitly commands three things regarding the festival of Sukkot:\n\n- To gather the “Four Species” (Lev. 23:40)\n\n- To rejoice before the Lord.\n\n- To live in a Sukkah (Lev. 23:42)\n\n- Etrog – a lemon-like citrus fruit referred to as “the fruit of beautiful trees”. The etrog symbolizes the heart, suggesting that the fruit of the humble heart is most beautiful in the eyes of heaven.\n\n- Lulav – a ripe date palm frond - “branches of palm trees”. The lulav must be sturdy and straight, with whole leaves that lay close together and are not broken at the top. It represents the spine or backbone of a person. A person who loves God with all his heart will be given a spiritual backbone, real conviction and strength.\n\n- Hadas – three myrtle branches – “boughs of leafy trees”. The leaves resemble the shape of eyes and therefore it is associated with seeing and vision.\n\n- Aravah – the leafy branch of a willow tree – “willows of the brook”. Two branches are needed for the “lulav” bundle. They represent the lips, the service of lips (prayer).\n\nThe four items are held together in a fragrant bouquet that is waved during each day of Sukkot. The usual practice is to recite the blessing and then wave the Lulav three times in six directions: forward, right, back, left, up and down – to proclaim God’s omnipresence.\n\nThe Sukkah is a four-legged structure that commemorates the temporary dwellings of the people of Israel while they were in the desert. It is customary to start building the Sukkah at the end of Yom Kippur and decorate its inside. The sukkah should be big enough to hold a table and chairs for the family to dine in it. Observant Jews also sleep in it.\n\nThe purpose of the sukkah is to remind us of our forefathers in the desert and remind us that we are only human, frail in comparison to nature and the Creator. While sitting in the sukkah we feel the weather elements just like the people of Israel.\n\nThis is the day that concludes the Feast of Sukkot.\n\nEach week in synagogues all around the world, a portion from the Torah is chanted (parashah). The Torah has been divided into 54 portions (parshiyot) – one for each week of the year – so that in a course of a year, the entire Torah has been recited in services.\n\nThe final reading of the Torah occurs on Simchat Torah, a rabbinical festival celebrating the completion of the year’s Torah reading and the beginning of a new cycle.\n\nDuring this holiday, the last Torah portion (from Deut.) is read as well as the first verses of the first portion (from Genesis), indicating that the study of Torah never ends. The idea that Torah study is cyclical finds expression in the joyous ritual of dancing round and round the Torah, known as hakafot.\n\nCredit: Parts of this article were written by John J.

The kapporet was the golden cover of the sacred chest in the Holy of Holies of the Temple, where the sacrificial blood was presented. </p><p>Originally, Yom Kippur was focused on the role of the high priest and the purification of the Sanctuary, but since the destruction of the Temple in 70 AD, Rabbinic tradition states that each Jew is supposed to focus on his personal service of the Lord. Most of the prayers on Yom Kippur, therefore, revolve around the central theme of personal repentance and return.</p><p>According to Jewish Law (Halacha), we must abstain from five forms of pleasure based on Lev. 23:27:</p><p>- Eating and drinking.</p><p>- Washing and bathing.</p><p>- Applying lotions or perfume.</p><p>- Wearing leather shoes.</p><p>- Marital relations.</p><p>The fast begins an hour before sundown on Tishrei 9th and lasts 25 hours. A special meal is usually prepared – the last meal before sundown, called Se’udah Mafseket. The meal includes candle-lighting and special blessings are recited.</p><p>Most of Yom Kippur is spent at the synagogue, praying and listening to chants. It is essentially the last appeal and chance to change the judgment of God, to demonstrate repentance and make amends. </p><p>On the 15th day of Tishrei, the joyous feast of Sukkot begins and lasts 7 days, immediately followed by Simchat Torah.</p><p>During this time many Jewish families build a Sukka, a four-legged structure built in haste to remember the huts in which the people of Israel lived in during their 40 years sojourn in the desert. Observant Jews eat all their meals in the Sukka and even sleep in it.</p><p>After the people of Israel entered the promised land, Sukkot was associated with the fall harvest and came to be known as Chag ha-Asif, the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year. Certain customs were incorporated into the observance of Sukkot, including decorating the Sukka, performing special “wave” ceremonies of the “Four Species”, and others.</p><p>We are commanded to rejoice during the holiday of Sukkot for the blessings of God’s provision and care for our lives (Deut. 16:14-15).</p><p> Sukkot is the conclusion of the Jewish fall holidays and the last of the three pilgrimage festivals (Passover, Shavu’ot, and Sukkot).</p><p>The word Joy/Rejoice appears several times regarding Sukkot. In ancient Israel, the joy of Sukkot was so great that it became known simply as “the Feast”. Later it was known as Z’man Simchatenu – The Season of Our Joy.</p><p>From an agricultural perspective in ancient Israel, Sukkot corresponded to the fruit harvest. Total joy would come after all the crops were harvested in the fall, and thereby receive sustenance and provision for the coming year from the Lord. For this reason, Sukkot is also referred to as Hag Ha’Asif – the Feast of Ingathering. </p><p>From a spiritual perspective, Sukkot corresponds to the joy of knowing your sins were forgiven (during Yom Kippur), and also recalls God’s miraculous provision and care, after the deliverance from bondage in Egypt. Prophetically, Sukkot anticipates the coming kingdom of Yeshua wherein all the nations shall come up to Jerusalem to worship the Lord during the Feast (Zech. 14:16). Today Sukkot is a time to remember God’s sheltering presence and provision for us for the start of the New Year. In light of the work of Yeshua, our High Priest, we now have access to the Heavenly Temple of God.</p><p>In biblical times, Sukkot was considered the most important of all the holidays. It is one of the three required festivals of the Lord.</p><p>The Torah explicitly commands three things regarding the festival of Sukkot:</p><p>- To gather the “Four Species” (Lev. 23:40)</p><p>- To rejoice before the Lord.</p><p>- To live in a Sukkah (Lev. 23:42)</p><p>- Etrog – a lemon-like citrus fruit referred to as “the fruit of beautiful trees”. The etrog symbolizes the heart, suggesting that the fruit of the humble heart is most beautiful in the eyes of heaven.</p><p>- Lulav – a ripe date palm frond - “branches of palm trees”. The lulav must be sturdy and straight, with whole leaves that lay close together and are not broken at the top. It represents the spine or backbone of a person. A person who loves God with all his heart will be given a spiritual backbone, real conviction and strength.</p><p>- Hadas – three myrtle branches – “boughs of leafy trees”. The leaves resemble the shape of eyes and therefore it is associated with seeing and vision.</p><p>- Aravah – the leafy branch of a willow tree – “willows of the brook”. Two branches are needed for the “lulav” bundle. They represent the lips, the service of lips (prayer). </p><p>The four items are held together in a fragrant bouquet that is waved during each day of Sukkot. The usual practice is to recite the blessing and then wave the Lulav three times in six directions: forward, right, back, left, up and down – to proclaim God’s omnipresence.</p><p>The Sukkah is a four-legged structure that commemorates the temporary dwellings of the people of Israel while they were in the desert. It is customary to start building the Sukkah at the end of Yom Kippur and decorate its inside. The sukkah should be big enough to hold a table and chairs for the family to dine in it. Observant Jews also sleep in it.</p><p>The purpose of the sukkah is to remind us of our forefathers in the desert and remind us that we are only human, frail in comparison to nature and the Creator. While sitting in the sukkah we feel the weather elements just like the people of Israel.</p><p>This is the day that concludes the Feast of Sukkot. </p><p>Each week in synagogues all around the world, a portion from the Torah is chanted (parashah). The Torah has been divided into 54 portions (parshiyot) – one for each week of the year – so that in a course of a year, the entire Torah has been recited in services.</p><p>The final reading of the Torah occurs on Simchat Torah, a rabbinical festival celebrating the completion of the year’s Torah reading and the beginning of a new cycle. </p><p>During this holiday, the last Torah portion (from Deut.) is read as well as the first verses of the first portion (from Genesis), indicating that the study of Torah never ends. The idea that Torah study is cyclical finds expression in the joyous ritual of dancing round and round the Torah, known as hakafot.</p><p>Credit:<br/> Parts of this article were written by John J.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe word Hanukkah means dedication. It’s an 8-day holiday that commemorates the rededication of the second temple after a small group of Jewish warriors (Maccabees) defeated the Greeks who were trying to secularize the Jewish faith. This year Hanukkah begins at sundown on Thursday, December 10.The Hebrew word Hanukkah is related to Khannach (dedicated, train, discipline) and Khanan (Grace, favor, pardon). Another name for this holiday is the Festival of Lights.The story of Hanukkah starts way back in 333BC, when Alexander the Great stormed through Syria, Egypt, and Babylonia (modern-day Iran/Iraq). Everywhere he conquered he demanded that the people give up their gods and worship the Greek pantheon of gods (Zeus, Venus, Apollo, and other gods). He made them speak Greek and learn Greek culture and law as well. When he marched into Jerusalem, he demanded that a golden statue be built in the temple honoring him. The High priest was shrewd and said, “we can’t do that, but we’ll have all of our firstborn sons take the name Alexander—they’ll be a living memorial of your greatness!” Sounded good to Alexander and that led to about 100 years of relative peace in the region.But all that changed in the year 168 BC.One of Alexander’s successors, Antiochus Epiphanes became king of Syria. He was an eccentric, cruel, and tyrannical dictator. He sought to eradicate the Jewish religion and establish Greek polytheism instead.The observance of all Jewish laws, including Sabbath, circumcision, and the study of the Torah, were forbidden under penalty of death. He plundered the city of Jerusalem, took 10,000 captives, stripped the temple of its treasures, and built a pagan altar on the great altar of Burnt Sacrifices.On the 25th of Kislev (Antiochus’ birthday), a sacrifice was brought on this altar for the first time. He required a swine to be offered in the Temple of God in Jerusalem, and every village. This was the ultimate blasphemy against God because swine are unclean according to the Law of Moses.\n\nIn the village of Modi’in, an aged priest named Mattathias lived with his 5 sons. He started a revolt against Antiochus, which grew into a full-scale uprising of rebels. Soon after, Mattathias died and left the leadership to his son Judah Maccabee (Maccabee means hammer). Under his brilliant leadership, what began as a guerrilla war turned into a full-scale military engagement in which the smaller Jewish forces managed to defeat the much more powerful Syrian armies, and they succeeded in throwing off the yoke of the Greek Empire.On the 3rd anniversary of the desecration of the Temple, on the 25th of Kislev, 164 B.C., the Temple worship was reestablished. The altar and all the vessels used in the earlier sacrilege were destroyed and replaced with new ones, and the Temple was rededicated. It is this rededication that is still celebrated among the Jews to this day as Hanukkah.\n\nIn later tradition, it has been told that at the time of the rededication, there was very little oil left to light the Menorah in the temple. That oil was supposed to last only for one day, but it would take eight days to make new oil. A miracle happened and the oil lasted for eight days.This story is actually only recorded in later Rabbinical writings.Nevertheless, the fact that a force so few in number could defeat the armies of the Syrian-Greeks cannot be overlooked. And the fact that the Temple was restored and rededicated is also a testimony to the power of God and His love for His people.\n\nIt is quite interesting to see that the holiday of Hanukkah is not mentioned anywhere in the Old Testament. The book of Maccabees (in which the story of Hanukkah is recorded) never made it into the Bible. The only place in the Bible that mentions Hanukkah is the New Testament.\n\nNow it was the Feast of Dedication in Jerusalem and it was winter. And Jesus walked in the Temple, in Solomon’s porch. Then the Jews surrounded Him and said to Him, “How long do you keep us in doubt? If you are the Christ tell us plainly”. Jesus answered them, “I told you and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.” - John 10:22-25\n\nThere are a few traditions that the Jewish people in Israel and all over the world do to observe the holiday:\n\n1. Lighting the Hanukkiah every evening for 8 days\n\n2. Eating food fried in oil to commemorate the miracle of the jar of oil\n\n3. Giving gifts or money or chocolate gelt to children\n\n4. Playing with a dreidel\n\nThe Hanukkiah symbolizes the Menorah (golden lampstand) that stood in the temple. It was one of the furnishings that God commanded Moses to place in the Tabernacle and was preserved throughout the years in the Temples. It is clear according to the Torah's instructions that the Menorah was to have the form of a stylized plant, like a small tree that has a trunk and branches bearing flowers and almonds. If so, we must ask the question: How could it be that the Torah commanded us to make a Menorah in the form of a tree, to be placed in the sanctuary of the Tabernacle, while elsewhere the Torah cautions, \"You shall not set up a sacred post – any kind of pole [or tree] beside the altar of the Lord your God that you may make\" (Deut. 16:21)?Here is one possible explanation: In the book of Genesis (chapter 2:9) it talks about the two trees in the Garden of Eden. One is the tree of knowledge and the second is the tree of life. Perhaps the tree of life is a representation of the eternal life we get through faith in Yeshua. Yeshua is also the Light of the World, which is reflected through the light of the Menorah. Another reflection of Yeshua in the Hanukkiah is that it has nine branches, of which one is higher than the rest (shamash, servant) and is used to light the other candles. Yeshua is like the Shamash. He is exalted, but He is also a servant, and He gives the light in our lives and to the world.As we think about what this Festival of Lights means to us as God’s people, we think of the testimony of those who stood up to secularism, to the defamation of their faith and said “No. No compromise! This altar belongs to the Lord--not to you!” The people who know their God will be strong and do exploits! That’s a pretty powerful message for us and the world we live in!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIf you have ever been wronged in life, you know what it feels like to be helpless, angry, and indignant. You might even be terrified to discover in your heart secret feelings of vengeance and struggle between letting God vindicate you, taking matters into your own hands - or both.If that's you, you are not alone. The eyes of the world are turned to the never-ending issue of social justice or the lack thereof, whether that be racial tension, physical and sexual abuse, poverty, discrimination, or bribery. One of these injustices alone would be enough to leave one deeply offended and forever victimized.Israel is no stranger to social injustices.In 2020 reports of domestic violence to the Ministry of Social Affairs have increased by 800%, police calls have increased by 22%, and a total of 26 women were murdered in cold blood by their partners. Covid-19 didn't just take a physical toll on those who became sick, but the many and prolonged quarantines created a prison for spouses and children stuck with a violent partner and an environment of economic tension.Unfortunately, it doesn't end there - at the end of 2021, the National Insurance reported that 21% of Israelis live below the poverty line, and 8.2% suffer from a lack of nutritional security. That means that over 800 thousand families will suffer hunger!Where is the solution? It seems that we hit a dead end when internal problems arise in the government and corruption takes over, replacing what could be an opportunity to bring recovery to the economy with politics and long discussions that often result in a lack of action.A working group that tends to suffer the most is social services, who are overloaded with much work and get paid very little, making the motivation to serve very low.The moral compass of many Israelis will not allow them to stay silent.Business owners march to end high living costs, the disabled block main highways in protest, and feminists rally together to end rape and murder culture, blaming a system that seems to turn a blind eye. Wherever you turn, there is no shortage of injustice in this small country we call home.Whether one fights for freedom in a small country such as Israel or stands with more famous movements like Black Lives Matter, the LGBTQ community, the MeToo movement, the message is the same: \"WE WANT JUSTICE - AND WE WANT IT NOW!\".Merriam-Webster defines justice as: 'the process or result of using laws to fairly judge and punish crimes and criminals.'A recent example is the Tokyo 2021 Olympic Boycott from many western nations over human rights abuse accusations. Their concern over the repression of the Uyghur Muslim minority and the mysterious disappearance and muzzling of tennis player Pend Shuai (accused a former top Communist Party official of sexual assault) has brought the nations to take a stand on the issue of human rights and social justice.The tricky part is where each country or individual's opinion of justice differs. As a democratic state, Israel has constitutionalized laws and rules for fundamental human rights such as the right to personal freedom, equality, the Nirenberg code so that Israelis can live in a free and healthy society. For those of us who have faith-based values, what is our standard, and how should we base our perception of justice?The Bible is full of examples showing God's character as both a righteous judge and a defensive father.When the Hebrews were set free from 400 years of slavery in Egypt, one of God's main priorities was teaching them right from wrong and good from evil.God started by giving them the Torah on Mt. Sinai, with the ten commandments as a moral beacon of light in an immoral world. He proceeds throughout the following books to show what righteousness looks like in action, giving very specific rules to protect the rights of his people, gentiles, slaves, and even animals. In Parashat Shoftim (Deuteronomy 16:18-21:9), the Torah reading portion \"Judges\", Moses instructs Israel to appoint judges and officials amongst the people and warns them not to abuse their authority, but to do what is right:\n\n\"Appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the Lord your God is giving you, and they shall judge the people fairly. Do not pervert justice or show partiality. Do not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the innocent. Follow justice and justice alone, so that you may live and possess the land the Lord your God is giving you.\" - Deuteronomy 16:18-20 (NIV)\n\nGod even gets into the nitty-gritty of how a society should conduct themselves in everyday life; for example, Exodus chapter 21 talks about the rights of slaves and those suffering from personal injuries:\n\n\"Anyone who strikes a person with a fatal blow is to be put to death. However, if it is not done intentionally, but God lets it happen, they are to flee to a place I will designate. But if anyone schemes and kills someone deliberately, that person is to be taken from my altar and put to death.\" - Exodus 21:12-14 (NIV)\n\nGod even gave a solution for the most difficult cases, guiding the people to turn to the Levitical priests who would come to God on behalf of a sinner, asking Him to judge righteously through them:\n\n\"If cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge—whether bloodshed, lawsuits or assaults—take them to the place the Lord your God will choose. Go to the Levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time. Inquire of them and they will give you the verdict.\" - Deuteronomy 17:8-9 (NIV)\n\nThe solution for human rights and social justice can be found in God and the many tools He gives us to overcome the hardships life throws our way. Be it forgiveness, the understanding of his word, or bible-based therapy and counseling–God's desire is for all to be healed.It can be easy to forget that despite the injustice in the world, we still serve an omnipresent God who sees every deed, whether good or bad, and has a just response to all of them.There is no wrong that will not be made right, and there is no darkness of any kind that can escape God's throne of righteousness. Perhaps, on the personal level, our part in partnering with God's justice on earth is holding ourselves to His standards of holiness (Leviticus 20:7), the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23), and God's definition of love (1 Corinthians 13:4-8).On the political level - God is calling political leaders to walk in accordance with the foundations of His justice. As a society, we should choose leaders who seek righteousness and walk in Biblical principles - hating bribery and considering the weak and the unprivileged as people who need justice. The word is clear, even when men fail to do justice - God never fails. If you have suffered injustices and have a hard time believing God will do right by you, know there is hope because we serve a good and loving God, and He is the protector of your soul and the defender of your heart.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nThe name of this festival is actually its date: “Tu” is a pronunciation of the Hebrew letters tet and vav, whose numerical value is the number 15. And Shvat is the name of the month. So essentially \"Tu Bishvat\" means the 15th of Shvat. It’s also known as Rosh Hashana La’ilanot, the new year of the trees.\n\nAt its start, Tu Bishvat was not a Jewish festival. Rather, it marked an important date for Jewish farmers in ancient times. The Torah states:\n\n“When you enter the land [of Israel] and plant any tree for food, you shall regard its fruit as forbidden. Three years it shall be forbidden for you, not to be eaten.” - Leviticus 19:23\n\nThe fruit of the fourth year was to be offered to the priests in the Temple as a gift of gratitude for the bounty of the land, and the fifth-year fruit–and all subsequent fruit–was finally for the farmer. This law, however, raised the question of how farmers were to mark the “birthday” of a tree. The Rabbis, therefore, established the 15th of the month of Shvat as a general “birthday” for all trees, regardless of when they were actually planted.\n\nFruit trees were awarded special status in the Torah because of their importance in sustaining life and as a symbol of God’s divine favor. Even during times of war, God warns the Israelites:\n\n“When in your war against a city you have to besiege it a long time in order to capture it, you must not destroy its trees… Are trees of the field human to withdraw before you into the besieged city? Only trees that you know do not yield food may be destroyed.” - Deuteronomy 20:19-20\n\nAt a later time, the Rabbis of the Talmud established four “new years” throughout the Jewish calendar–Rosh Hashanah, or the Jewish new year for the calendar date; a new year for establishing the reign of kings; a new year for tithing animals of Jewish farmers to be given to the Temple; and finally, Tu Bishvat, the new year for the trees (Mishnah, Rosh Hashanah 1:1). The Rabbis discussed why this date was chosen; saying that Tu Bishvat falls after mid-winter (usually in February), they concluded that the majority of the annual rainfall has usually already fallen by this time in the land of Israel, thus yielding a healthy, water-logged soil in which to plant new trees (Talmud, Rosh Hashanah 14a).\n\nAccording to Deuteronomy 8:8, there are five fruits and two grains associated with Israel as a “land of wheat and barley, of vines [grapes], figs and pomegranates, a land of olive trees, and [date] honey.” Jews also give a prominent place to almonds in Tu Bishvat, since the almond trees were believed to be the first of all trees in Israel to blossom. Carob, also known as St. John’s bread, became another popular fruit to eat on Tu Bishvat since it could survive the long trip from Israel to Jewish communities in Europe.\n\nWhen Jewish pioneers began returning to the land of Israel in the late 19th century, Tu Bishvat became an opportunity for these ardent agrarians to celebrate the bounty of a restored ecology in Israel. In ancient times, the land of Israel was once fertile and well forested. Over centuries of repeated conquests, destructions, and desertification, Israel was denuded of trees.\n\nThe early Zionists seized upon Tu Bishvat as an opportunity to celebrate their tree-planting efforts to restore the ecology of ancient Israel and as a symbol of renewed growth and flowering of the Jewish people returning to their ancestral homeland.\n\nTu Bishvat has become a symbol of both a Zionist attachment to the land of Israel as well as an example of Jewish sensitivity to the environment.\n\nEarly Jewish settlers to Israel began planting new trees not only to restore the ecology of ancient Israel but as a symbol of renewed growth of the Jewish people returning to their ancestral homeland.\n\nMany American and European Jews observe Tu Bishvat by contributing money to the Jewish National Fund (JNF), an organization devoted to reforesting Israel (the purchase of trees in JNF forests is also customary to commemorate a celebration such as a Bar or Bat-Mitzvah).\n\nIn modern times, Tu Bishvat continues to be an opportunity for planting trees — in Israel and elsewhere, wherever Jews live. Many parents donate to the JNF every year on Tu Bishvat in honor of their children.\n\nTu Bishvat, or the “birthday” of all fruit trees, is a minor festival seemingly tailor-made for today’s Jewish environmentalists. In fact, there is an ancient midrash (rabbinic teaching) that states:\n\n“When God led Adam around the Garden of Eden, God said, ‘Look at My works. See how beautiful they are, how excellent! For your sake I created them all. See to it that you do not spoil or destroy My world–for if you do, there will be no one to repair it after you’.” - (Ecclesiastes Rabbah 7:13) Text credit: www.myjewishlearning.com\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nFrom Abraham becoming the Father of the Jewish people and the nation of Israel, to God making a covenant with the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to God establishing the modern Jewish state in 1948, it is truly amazing to see how God has made Israel into a great nation. God has also made it very clear that His blessing on the nation of Israel does not have to do with Israel’s righteousness, but instead because of God’s righteousness and sovereign choice.\n\n“It is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land; but on account of the wickedness of these nations, the Lord your God will drive them out before you, to accomplish what he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” — Deuteronomy 9:5\n\nSo, as we look back through biblical history and see the modern-day state of Israel today, a question on our minds may be “Why Israel?” God loves all people, and yet He still has a special purpose for the descendants of Israel. God has kept his oath with the Jewish people for a thousand generations, and it is time for the world to see a prophetic convergence. A convergence is a time when two or more things come together to form a new whole. Therefore, the prophetic convergence we see is God bringing together biblical prophecies about Israel and the Jewish people to bring about something new. God has blessed the Jewish people with many things that have been a blessing to the entire world. A few of these treasures include the 10 Commandments, the gift of Shabbat, and the Feasts of the Lord (Passover, Shavuot, Feast of Trumpets, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot).Today, we can see the favor of God that rests on the nation of Israel through the world of business. According to Wikipedia, Israel has over 6,000 startups and over 30 tech companies valued at 1 billion dollars. Many innovations have been created here in Israel like the USB Flash drive, Lazor keyboard, VOIP-Voice Over Internet Protocol, ReWalk Robotics for Paraplegics, Waze, Iron Dome Air Defense System, cherry tomatoes, Rummikub game, Soda Stream, Amazon Kindle, and more! Amazingly, all of this has been accomplished amid wars, rocket attacks, threats, and more, throughout the 76 years of the modern-day Jewish state of Israel.\n\nEvery Arab nation that has made peace with Israel is being blessed and flourishing, like Egypt, Jordan, Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Morrocco, and Chad. However, those nations that have not made peace with Israel are starving and suffering from poverty like Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Lebanon.The nation of Israel and the Jewish people have done as much as possible to come to a place of peace between Jews and Arabs. We live daily life together, work together, vote together, travel on planes together, and more. However, because there are extreme Jihadists like Hamas and Hezbollah that want to wipe out all of Israel, it creates great tension between Jews and Arabs. In conclusion, what can you do to bless Israel? Some practical things you could do are come to Israel, take a stand against replacement theology, write a letter to your politicians to strengthen the relationship with Israel, and consistently pray for Israel and the Jewish people.\n\n“Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: ‘May those who love you be secure. May there be peace within your walls and security within your citadels.’ For the sake of my family and friends, I will say, ‘Peace be within you.’ For the sake of the house of the Lord our God, I will seek your prosperity.” — Psalm 122:6-9\n\nBoth Jews and Gentiles play a vital role in God’s prophetic convergence plan for Israel and the world right now!

      "excerpt": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War",
      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nIn Israel today, we commemorate the Day of Atonement as a Sabbath day, when the whole country ceases work, and the roads are empty of cars and closed for travel. It has such great cultural influence that even secular Jews keep the traditions of what is considered the holiest day of the Hebrew calendar.Jews dress in white and gather to have a last meal (called 'se'uda mafseket') before fasting food and drink beginning at sunset on the eve of Yom Kippur till the setting of the sun the day after. As we prepare to receive this somber day, we pray special prayers of repentance at the synagogue and Wailing Wall, plead for forgiveness, and confess our sins.Since the time of Moses, God made a way for the people to be reconciled to Him through sacrificing animals until blood more powerful than that of bulls or goats was offered, but that was yet to be revealed.\n\nIn the Old Testament, in the book of Leviticus, we read how God — through Moses — instructs the people to set aside a day in which they should fast and make sin offerings, purifying themselves before Him:\n\n\"Also the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the Day of Atonement. It shall be a holy convocation for you; you shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by fire to the Lord. And you shall do no work on that same day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement for you before the Lord your God.\" – Leviticus 23:27-28\n\nAtonement is the act of reparation for an offense or injury; in the case of the people of Israel, the High priest would first offer a sin offering for himself and his family:\n\n\"Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering, which is for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house. He shall take the two goats and present them before the Lord at the door of the tabernacle of meeting. Then Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats: one lot for the Lord and the other lot for the scapegoat. And Aaron shall bring the goat on which the Lord's lot fell, and offer it as a sin offering. But the goat on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the Lord, to make atonement upon it, and to let it go as the scapegoat into the wilderness.\" – Leviticus 16: 6-10\n\nAfter he and his family purified themselves, the High Priest would then offer a second sin offering on behalf of the people - the blood of a goat:\n\n\"Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, which is for the people, bring its blood inside the veil, do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and before the mercy seat. So he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, for all their sins; and so he shall do for the tabernacle of meeting which remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness.\" – Leviticus 16:15-16\n\nToday, since there is no temple and no more animal sacrifices, Jews have found other ways of atoning for sin.During the ten days between Yom Teru’ah (also known as Rosh Hashanah) and the Day of Atonement, thousands of Jews go to Jerusalem, pray at the Western Wall, and beg God for mercy while touching the original temple stones.Another tradition includes swinging a chicken in circles around the sinner's head and transferring their sins to the animal — a process called 'kaparot', which means to atone. The chicken is then slaughtered and given to the poor.Many people give charity as a money offering; men dip in the Mikveh to purify themselves, and others pray at the 'graves of the righteous', believing that the closer they are to great figures of faith, the more likely God is to hear them.Jews living in Israel today care greatly to keep the commands of Yom Kippur and yearn for God's forgiveness with all their hearts.Yet, the eyes of many of the Jewish people are veiled, unable to see that there is only one way in which they can truly be reconciled to God and that is through the atoning blood of Yeshua, their Messiah.The scapegoat and the role of the high priest were a shadow, a precursor of Yeshua, as He is the scapegoat, taking on Himself the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), and the High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16) who stood in the gap on behalf of the people. It is only through the revelation of the saving power of Yeshua that anyone can experience forgiveness of sins.\n\nForgiveness is a precious gift, which sets the captives free from oppression, reconciles hearts, and heals the broken. Yeshua declared that He is the \"way, the truth, and the life\" (John 14:6) and that no one comes to the Father but through Him.Sin has ruled in the hearts of man since Adam first sinned in the garden of Eden, but when we receive Yeshua's forgiveness by accepting his ways and receiving the truth, we can truly become alive in Him and receive eternal life.By confessing our sins, we throw sin off the throne of our hearts and crown Yeshua as King of our lives, allowing His Holy Spirit to change us from the inside out — in our words, actions and intentions:\n\n\"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.\" - Romans 12:2\n\nAlthough in the past, forgiveness was given only on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), once a year, Yeshua, who sacrificed Himself to atone for our sins forever, made a covenant with Jews and Gentiles in his blood:\n\n\"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\" - Matthew 26:28\n\nThank God He sent Yeshua, the Yom Kippur sacrifice who made a way for all to enter into right standing with God — being our scapegoat, our High priest, our redeemer, and our King Messiah.This Yom Kippur, as we pray for the atonement of our sins before His mercy seat, let us remember our Jewish brothers and sisters who have not yet received Yeshua's free gift of eternal forgiveness.\n\nAbba, Elohim — thank you for giving us your Son Yeshua, whose blood atones our sins. Forgive me today of my wrongdoing; create in me a pure heart so my life will be pleasing to you. I forgive those who have sinned against me and bless them in your name.Please grant me the grace to live according to your holiness and open the eyes of Israel to see you as their redeeming Messiah. Amen, and amen!\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

So he shall make atonement for the Holy Place, because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions, for all their sins; and so he shall do for the tabernacle of meeting which remains among them in the midst of their uncleanness.\" </strong>– Leviticus 16:15-16</em></p><p>Today, since there is no temple and no more animal sacrifices, Jews have found other ways of atoning for sin.<br/><br/>During the ten days between Yom Teru’ah (also known as Rosh Hashanah) and the Day of Atonement, thousands of Jews go to Jerusalem, pray at the Western Wall, and beg God for mercy while touching the original temple stones.<br/><br/>Another tradition includes swinging a chicken in circles around the sinner's head and transferring their sins to the animal — a process called 'kaparot', which means to atone. The chicken is then slaughtered and given to the poor.<br/><br/>Many people give charity as a money offering; men dip in the Mikveh to purify themselves, and others pray at the 'graves of the righteous', believing that the closer they are to great figures of faith, the more likely God is to hear them.<br/><br/>Jews living in Israel today care greatly to keep the commands of Yom Kippur and yearn for God's forgiveness with all their hearts.<br/><br/>Yet, the eyes of many of the Jewish people are veiled, unable to see that there is only one way in which they can truly be reconciled to God and that is through the atoning blood of Yeshua, their Messiah.<br/><br/>The scapegoat and the role of the high priest were a shadow, a precursor of Yeshua, as He is the scapegoat, taking on Himself the sins of the world (2 Corinthians 5:21), and the High Priest (Hebrews 4:14-16) who stood in the gap on behalf of the people. <br/><br/>It is only through the revelation of the saving power of Yeshua that anyone can experience forgiveness of sins.</p><p>Forgiveness is a precious gift, which sets the captives free from oppression, reconciles hearts, and heals the broken. <br/><br/>Yeshua declared that He is the \"way, the truth, and the life\" (John 14:6) and that no one comes to the Father but through Him.<br/><br/>Sin has ruled in the hearts of man since Adam first sinned in the garden of Eden, but when we receive Yeshua's forgiveness by accepting his ways and receiving the truth, we can truly become alive in Him and receive eternal life.<br/><br/>By confessing our sins, we throw sin off the throne of our hearts and crown Yeshua as King of our lives, allowing His Holy Spirit to change us from the inside out — in our words, actions and intentions:</p><p><em><strong>\"Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.\" </strong>- Romans 12:2</em></p><p>Although in the past, forgiveness was given only on Yom Kippur (the Day of Atonement), once a year, Yeshua, who sacrificed Himself to atone for our sins forever, made a covenant with Jews and Gentiles in his blood:</p><p><em><strong>\"This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.\" </strong>- Matthew 26:28</em></p><p>Thank God He sent Yeshua, the Yom Kippur sacrifice who made a way for all to enter into right standing with God — being our scapegoat, our High priest, our redeemer, and our King Messiah.<br/><br/>This Yom Kippur, as we pray for the atonement of our sins before His mercy seat, let us remember our Jewish brothers and sisters who have not yet received Yeshua's free gift of eternal forgiveness.</p><p><strong><em>Abba, Elohim — thank you for giving us your Son Yeshua, whose blood atones our sins. Forgive me today of my wrongdoing; create in me a pure heart so my life will be pleasing to you. I forgive those who have sinned against me and bless them in your name.</em></strong><br/><br/><strong><em>Please grant me the grace to live according to your holiness and open the eyes of Israel to see you as their redeeming Messiah.</em></strong><br/><br/><strong><em> Amen, and amen!</em></strong></p><p>Stay UPDATED on key events from around the world.<br/>LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.<br/>PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.</p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nYom Yerushalayim, or Jerusalem Day, is a relatively new addition to the Hebrew calendar that commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem under Jewish sovereignty in 1967. Celebrated on the 28th day of Iyar, May 19 this year, the holiday marks a pivotal moment in Jewish history and the continued importance of Jerusalem as a spiritual capital.\n\nFor over a millennium, Jerusalem has served as the capital of the Jewish people. King David conquered the city around 1000 BCE and established his monarchy there. However, Jerusalem was later conquered twice, the second time by the Romans in 70 C.E., which was a significant event in Jewish history. Since then, Jews have mourned the loss of Jerusalem for thousands of years, including an official day of mourning every year on Tisha B’Av. Although they have been in exile for two millennia, Jerusalem remains the Jews’ spiritual capital. Jews still pray facing Jerusalem and make references to the city in their religious services to this day.The city was divided between Israel and Jordan after the Israeli War of Independence in 1948, with East Jerusalem (where the wailing wall is located) falling under Jordanian control and West Jerusalem remaining under Israeli control.On the third day of the Six-Day War in June 1967, the Israeli army captured East Jerusalem, marking the first time in thousands of years that the entire city was under Jewish control. This victory allowed Jews access to the holiest part of the city — the Western Wall, the only remnant of the holy Temple.\n\nDue to the young age of Yom Yerushalayim, specific customs and traditions are still emerging. The holiday is becoming a pilgrimage day when thousands of Israelis travel to Jerusalem to show solidarity with the city. This solidarity is particularly important as the international community has never approved the \"reunification\" of the city under Israeli sovereignty, with many countries not recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish state.The Israeli education system devotes the week preceding Yom Yerushalayim to enhancing students' knowledge of the city's history and geography, emphasizing its unique role in Jewish messianic aspirations since Biblical times.\n\nThe religious status of Yom Yerushalayim is somewhat ambiguous compared to Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israel Independence Day). Following the model of Yom Ha'atzmaut, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel decided that Yom Yerushalayim should also be marked with the recitation of Hallel (psalms of praise) and a lengthier version of Psukei d'Zimra (the psalms in the earlier part of the morning service). Israel's Progressive (Reform) prayer book notes that Hallel should be recited on Yom Yerushalayim, but not so the Masorti (Conservative) prayer book, which suggests a list of supplemental readings for this day.The holiday's religious ambiguity is also reflected in the celebrations outside of Israel. While Jerusalem has significant meaning for all Jews, Yom Yerushalayim has yet to attain the popularity of Yom Ha'atzmaut and is not observed extensively outside of Israel.Nonetheless, Yom Yerushalayim remains an important day for many Jews to celebrate the reunification of Jerusalem and the political independence of the Jewish people. As the holiday continues to evolve, its significance as a symbol of unity and perseverance will no doubt remain a focal point for Jewish communities worldwide.A quote from Psalm 122:3, often cited in Yom Yerushalayim celebrations, serves as a reminder of the unity the day represents: \"Ir shechubrah lah yachdav” — a city that was joined together.\n\nA notable celebration marking Yom Yerushalayim is the Rikudgalim, or Dance of Flags, which is a flag-waving parade involving thousands of people, particularly young religious Zionist Jews. Participants march through the streets of Jerusalem, many wearing blue and white – the colors of the Israeli flag – to demonstrate their love and support for the city.The parade typically begins in the western part of Jerusalem and continues through the Jaffa Gate into the Old City, culminating at the Western Wall. This procession not only serves as a joyous celebration of the reunification of Jerusalem but also as a symbol of the Jewish connection to the city's historical and religious sites.\n\nThough Yom Yerushalayim is not as widely celebrated outside of Israel, Jewish communities around the world often hold events and activities to honor the day. Synagogues, schools, and community centers may host special prayer services, lectures, and discussions about the significance of Jerusalem in Jewish history and tradition.In some communities, solidarity marches or gatherings are organized to express support for Israel and the Jewish people's connection to Jerusalem. These events can include live music, speeches, and educational activities for children and adults alike, fostering a sense of unity and pride in Jewish heritage.\n\nYom Yerushalayim has not been without its challenges and controversies. The reunification of Jerusalem under Israeli control remains a controversial issue, with the international community largely not recognizing the city as the undivided capital of Israel. Additionally, the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem and the West Bank sees the celebration of Yom Yerushalayim as a provocative act that undermines their claims to the eastern part of the city.In recent years, the Dance of Flags parade has been criticized for its route through Muslim-majority neighborhoods, leading to tension and sometimes clashes between participants and Arab residents. As a result, alternative routes and security measures have been proposed and implemented to minimize the potential for conflict.Despite these challenges, Yom Yerushalayim continues to be a significant holiday for many Jewish people. It serves as a reminder of the historical, religious, and cultural importance of Jerusalem and the ongoing struggle to maintain a Jewish presence in the city.\n\nYom Yerushalayim is a day to celebrate the reunification of Jerusalem and the Jewish people's connection to their eternal capital. While the holiday is not as widely observed as Yom Ha'atzmaut, it remains an important occasion for many Jews to express their love and devotion to the city of Jerusalem.

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nMany of you have heard these famous words spoken by Yeshua, but let’s take a look at the implication of these words during this unique holiday season. A new month has begun both on the Jewish calendar and the Gregorian calendar. The month of Kislev and the last month of the year December. This special season has great significance both for the Jewish people and Christians around the world. During this time Jewish people across the globe celebrate Hanukkah. This celebration is held on the 25th day of Kislev. The name of the month derives from Akkadian kislimu. The Hebrew root K.S.L as in the words \"kesel, kisla\" (hope) or \"ksil\" (Orion, a constellation that shines) because of the expectation and hope. We believe this season of the month of Kislev is a time to renew our hearts before the Lord. It is a time to rededicate ourselves to God, rejoice in his miracle working power, and draw nearer to His heart. Hanukkah is a feast of lights and commemorates the miracle of the oil in the Menorah that lasted for eight days. As you walk the streets of Israel, you can see the Chanukiyot (nine branches menorahs) lit in the windows for all to see as they pass by. The month of December is also a time where many Christians are celebrating Christmas, decorating their homes with lights and there is so much festivity in the air. Light symbolizes joy and celebration. It is fascinating to see that these two different holidays actually point us in a very similar direction: To cast darkness and be as a shining light to the people of this world! Both Hanukkah and Christmas are times of great joy, where we celebrate amazing miracles and great victories that God has done. Hanukkah is also a celebration of the dedication of the temple. Therefore, let us take this month of Kislev to rededicate our lives again to the Lord and to share our love and joy with the less fortunate. We, at Vision for Israel, want to remind you that the miracle of our existence has been made possible because of your dedication. Let us continue to bless all those who need our help. We appreciate your gift - you can give here. This holiday season we pray that you will shine bright for all to see His great love!

The greed and self-righteousness of some lead to poverty and suffering for others. Our team sees the effects of this in the families and individuals that we help. The purpose of World Day of Social Justice is to achieve support for social integration and equality. It focuses on issues like poverty, housing insecurity, unemployment, exclusion, and more.These issues lead to lasting effects for the individuals who experience them. Those who live in poverty suffer from higher rates of mental illness and are 3 times more likely to commit suicide than individuals with financial support.On February 20th, our aim is to spread awareness of what can be done, as well as show the profound effects that social justice can have on a community. Efforts to help those less fortunate are effective and make a significant difference.Vision for Israel provides an opportunity for you to engage in social justice at any time of the year. Our mission is to provide financial assistance, essential supplies, and rehabilitation opportunities for individuals and families experiencing poverty. We provide opportunities for these families to feel included, cared for, and “normal.” We know that their circumstances do not define them; God loves them regardless of their social or financial status.At Vision for Israel, we are working on rehabilitation through music and the arts. The workshops we provide approach social justice from a new angle, giving several groups of people an opportunity to grow and heal. However, this can only be done with your help. The cost for each participant is about $200 and our goal is to sponsor 100 people. This low amount has the capacity to change endless lives, and further the mission of social justice well into the future.We value your donations and rely heavily on your support. God calls all of us to serve, you can answer that call by donating here.

Those who live in poverty suffer from higher rates of mental illness and are 3 times more likely to commit suicide than individuals with financial support.<br/>On February 20th, our aim is to spread awareness of what can be done, as well as show the profound effects that social justice can have on a community. Efforts to help those less fortunate are effective and make a significant difference.<br/><br/></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>",

      "content": "Donate to help Israeli families and those on the frontlines during Iron Swords War\n\nDear Friends,In just a few weeks, the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah will begin—this year on Christmas Day, a rare occasion that reminds us of our shared faith. During this time of celebration, Vision for Israel will host a special Hanukkah gathering for 50 Holocaust survivors at the Millennium Center. These gatherings offer survivors a place of peace and healing—a precious opportunity to share stories, lift burdens, and find comfort together.For the 137,000 Holocaust survivors living in Israel, this year has brought more than the typical weight of aging and illness. Since the events of October 7, many of them have faced the resurfacing of profound fears and memories, even leading to deterioration in both mental and physical health. Recent reports reveal that 73% of survivors have seen a decline in their mental state, with 64% experiencing worsened health conditions. For many, the memories of their suffering have been reawakened by the present reality of war, rekindling the heartache of their younger years.Imagine what it feels like to have lived through unspeakable horrors in your youth, only to find yourself reliving that terror in your final years. Chaya, a Holocaust survivor born in Thessaloniki, recalls her family’s struggle to escape when the Nazis arrived. She lost her mother in front of her eyes and survived by hiding with her sisters, only to emerge years later, traumatized but resolute to begin anew in Israel. Though she raised six children, her life has not been free of hardship. Losing one child to cancer, struggling with another’s illness, and enduring other personal tragedies, Chaya’s strength is unwavering, but her heart is weary. Today, she battles anxiety and grief, fighting a daily battle that no one should face alone.This season, as we gather with our own families, let us remember the survivors who are part of our broader family in faith. As we kindle the lights of Hanukkah, we have a powerful opportunity to bring them comfort and hope, showing them they are not forgotten. Through our Aid to the Poor fund, your year-end gift will go directly to meeting the needs of Holocaust survivors—people like Chaya—who need our compassion now more than ever.Every gift helps provide food, emotional support, medical assistance, and financial aid to those who can no longer manage on their own. Together, we can bring light to their lives, reminding them they are cherished and standing as witnesses to the promise that no darkness will overcome our shared light of hope.As you consider your year-end giving, will you help us restore joy and ease the burdens of our precious Holocaust survivors this Hanukkah? Your generosity at this time will ensure that, even in these difficult days, they feel the warmth of our prayers, presence, and support. Donate now and dedicate your donation to Aid to the Poor.WATCH what you’re donations have accomplished so far in 2024!Thank you for being a true beacon of love and hope.Chag Urim Same’ach, Barry & Batya\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

The personal stories of these families are heart-wrenching, and among them is Liat's account from Kibbutz Be'eri.Liat's world turned upside down on that fateful Saturday morning on October 7. Awakened by explosions, she found herself amidst a horrific attack. As terrorists stormed through the kibbutz, she and others, including small children, hid in a safe room, facing many hours of fear and uncertainty. The community was besieged, and the ensuing chaos was unimaginable. Families like Liat's faced terror, loss, and the destruction of everything familiar.After enduring hours of terror, Liat and her neighbors were rescued under harrowing circumstances, escaping amidst ongoing gunfights and the smell of war. The relief of rescue was profound, yet the pain of loss was overwhelming. She recounts her return to Kibbutz Be'eri a month later, finding her neighborhood unrecognizable, miraculously, her home still standing amidst the devastation.Liat's story is just one of many. Today, 126,000 evacuees sheltered in hotels face the grim reality of returning to their destroyed homes. Many are unemployed, without the means to rebuild. The government and insurance companies will aid in structural rebuilding, but the heart of a home - its furnishings, appliances, the essence of everyday life - is the responsibility of each family.Vision for Israel is committed to helping these families rebuild their homes and their lives. Our goal is to provide $10,000 each to 200 families, particularly those with five or more members. This sums to a total of $2,000,000, aimed at restoring essentials like furniture, electrical appliances, and linens.Your support has always been the cornerstone of our efforts. We call upon you, our generous supporters, to stand with these families. Your donation can transform lives, rebuild homes, and restore hope in the hearts of many. Together, we can bring stability and comfort back to those who have lost so much.As we embark on this journey of restoration, let us remember the power of unity and compassion. Your support is not just a donation; it's a beacon of hope, a testament to the strength of the community.Your contribution can transform lives and restore hope.

We were able to add a little sweetness amid the bitterness of the war to families and soldiers during Passover, host amazing volunteers from around the world, place shelters while rocket attacks persist, provide fire equipment to a community in the North, and more! Take a look at this report to see the faces of the people God has impacted through your generous prayers and support over these last few months!\n\nEvery year VFI provides financial assistance to families in need during Passover, so they can put food on the holiday table and celebrate with dignity. This year our team had the honor to bless 1,374 families with gift cards to help make their Passover holiday a little bit sweeter even through the bitterness of the war and the loss of their loved ones. We were able to deliver the gift cards to families in several different cities throughout Israel, including Gedera, Ashdod, Ma'ale Adumim, Jerusalem, Petah Tikva, and Kiryat Malachi.\n\nThis Passover, as we were all sitting around our tables, there were thousands of IDF soldiers on guard and fighting for our protection. Throughout the years, VFI has supported the Golani Brigade along with lone soldiers with gift cards during the holidays. This year we supported 300 soldiers who fought for four consecutive months inside Gaza with a special gift card of 250 NIS each. This was one small way to show our appreciation to these soldiers who have sacrificed so much, been away from their families and homes, risked their lives day after day, and bravely fought against terrorists to protect our nation.\n\nIn the last couple of months, several tour groups have come from around the world to serve with us for a day. So far, we have had groups from the USA, Kenya, and Germany. These precious and faithful volunteers have helped us by sorting clothes for families in need, packing food baskets, and helping with anything else needed to get done at the Millennium Center. Our team at VFI is so grateful for these willing volunteers who have traveled to Israel during this time of war to help serve the Jewish people and make an impact on this nation!\n\nIn April, VFI was able to install 12 new safety shelters throughout Israel. Even as the war with Hamas in the South, missile attacks from Iran, and continual rocket attacks from Hezbollah in the North continue, we have persisted in placing new shelters to help provide safety and protection to the citizens of Israel. Barry has been so faithful to be on-site at the placing of each of the new shelters. Time and time again, Barry has left everything to drive at any distance to witness with his own eyes that each shelter is correctly placed.\n\nThis May VFI installed 30 shelters in the North of Israel. We placed these shelters next to synagogues, schools, bus stops, swimming pools, and sports centers throughout Kiryat Shmona, Upper Galilee, Kfar Blum, Marom HaGilil, Hazor HaGalilit, Ma'alot Tarshiha, and the settlements of the Ma'ale Yosef Regional Council.Even on Holocaust Remembrance Day, we had the honor of placing 10 additional shelters on the northern border of Israel. We give God all the glory for the 253 shelters (92 in the North & 161 in the South) that have been placed in Israel since we began this project.\n\nAs summer heats up and rocket fire from Lebanon continues, fires breaking out in the North of Israel become a common hazard. Therefore, we donated a portable fire extinguishing system to Kibbutz Sde Nehemiah, which is located in the Upper Galilee. This small system fits in the back of a pickup truck and provides a quick and portable solution to help fight fires. After delivering the equipment, we toured the kibbutz's war room and learned about the projects they started since the beginning of the war, how they deal with a severe lack of protection, and their desire to function as a strong community.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

Our team at Vision for Israel cares for the food security of hundreds of poor people, and over the past few months, we have distributed hundreds of food baskets--as well as financial vouchers for fresh food, toiletries, and clothing. The distributions were given to families in need in Jerusalem and the areas, Modiin and Rishon Letzion. We were delighted to see the faces of these precious people.\n\nThis year, summer vacation carries with it a special meaning for the children of Israel. After having endured so much—a global pandemic followed closely by a war with Gaza—tensions and anxiety have been high. That’s why this year we are distributing 2,500 school packs to children going into the primary grades. We were so thrilled to get the schoolbags into the hands of those kids who are excited to receive them.\n\nSince 1999, Vision for Israel has helped to provide for the needs of 275,000 children throughout Israel. Each year, we improve the way we distribute, and the quality of the school bags. Even despite Coronavirus, we found creative ways to reach out to the children. We are thrilled to have so many faithful volunteers coming regularly to help us with the packing of all the goodies that fill these children’s bags.\n\nHolocaust survivors, who survived the horrors and came to Israel to find a home and rest, are haunted by the difficult memories, and most of them suffer from severe loneliness, financial distress, and health problems. We distributed about 80 food baskets to Holocaust survivors from Rishon Lezion. The survivors rejoiced at receiving the baskets which are rich in nutritious and healthy ingredients.\n\nWe have partnered with the Foundation for the Benefit of Holocaust survivors, and have run an initiative to fund emergency button services in the homes of Holocaust survivors. So far, we’ve enabled about 800 Holocaust survivors to call immediately for help (doctor or ambulance) in any case of distress—24 hours a day, 365 days a year—whether living alone in their homes or in sheltered housing.\n\nWe receive so much joy by being able to bless this family that came out of the tragedy and is doing all they can to overcome the terror attack they faced years ago. We have been supporting the family financially for several years and recently provided them with 6 months of supplies for their twin babies—including baby formula, diapers, clothes, and toiletries. VFI also donated appliances and other household items.\n\nOur new donated ambulance was recently released from customs, and Barry went down to the bonded warehouse facility with MDA and the UK director for a short dedication ceremony. This new ambulance is going to serve the city of Modiin, in the area where the Millennium Center is located.All of the VFI donated emergency vehicles have now responded to over 30,000 calls and so many of them life-saving.\n\nFor those living in Israel, rocket attacks from Gaza are not uncommon—but the scale, severity, and range of targets involved in the latest war with Gaza has truly been unprecedented. Once a siren is heard, there are only 15-45 seconds to enter a protected area. We were urgently asked to help and provide lifesaving equipment designed for these emergencies, to provide public protection; mobile shelters, emergency locking systems, and bomb blast doors. We are currently in the process of funding the purchase of mobile shelter units and are continuing to raise funds for this important project.\n\nRecently we got to know the Shavo family. The father, is 60 years old today. He can’t work due to his medical condition. In 1996 he was ambushed by radical terrorists and they stoned him. In self-defense, he responded by shooting at the ground to drive them away and one of the terrorists claimed that he got injured. This led to over 15 years of legal battles resulting in financial distress. In 2002 he lost his wife and three of their children in a separate terror attack. Thankfully he and four of his children survived. Recently we appealed to all of you to help the family. Some of you, our dear friends, have responded and he has now paid his debt fully. Thank you.\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",

When you take a moment to remember, you will see the many good things that God poured out on your life just today. As we recount the deeds and blessings of God, we give him the honor, respect and glory that He so rightfully deserves. Therefore, let us take time to remember what God has done and mark them as milestones in our lives. It is good to learn from the past, to live in the present, and to plan for the future. We, at Vision for Israel, want to take time to give glory to God for His actions in our lives and in the lives of our organization. Over the years we have been blessed with many volunteers and loyal employees. Many have been faithful to the vision and call to serve God, and in return they were surprisingly blessed.One of our secretaries named Sophia was born in Russia and immigrated to Israel as a little girl. She was married with one child, but had prayed for 11 years to be able to have another child. After working with us for several months, she became pregnant and gave birth to a lovely baby girl. Another secretary named Zoya had a similar past as Sophia. Zoya was also married, unable to have children for many years, and became pregnant within only a few months of working for VFI.There have been countless blessings poured out on the volunteers at Vision for Israel. More than ten couples met each other as they served together with us here in Israel. It is encouraging to see those who come to serve the Lord in Israel are so blessed. VFI is not only pouring out blessings to the people of Israel, but God is also abundantly blessing the faithful staff and volunteers at VFI. We have been grateful to witness the growth and blessings in the personal lives of our team and volunteers. We believe that we will continue to see wonderful growth from all directions in this coming year of 2023. Thank you dear friends for working together with Jews and Christians to build a better place here in the land of Israel. We honor you for partnering with us to pour out God’s blessing on the Jewish people.We invite you to build the future with us by partnering with Vision for Israel in prayer and financially supporting specific projects for this new year of 2023.\n\nAlthough the income from donations decreased slightly in 2022, God miraculously helped us increase our aid by 20%! Our vision for this year is to increase our support more than ever. Poverty is rapidly growing and every 4th adult lives in poverty. We also hope to open our special rehab program for people who suffered from violence. We are believing the Lord to do many more miracles this year in and through Vision for Israel. We look forward to partnering with you to impact many more lives here in the land of Israel.

You also likely know the number of day-to-day tasks and activities that go into making Vision for Israel work. Sometimes, volunteers handle these tasks, while other times Barry or myself shoulder the responsibility. Some years ago, one of these tasks turned into a wonderful chance encounter.For months, our accountants had been trying to take care of a number of documents from the government’s public non-profit institution division. There was no response from this government office for some time, and we began to feel desperate. I decided to simply go to the office during reception hours and get the required documents.I arrived and was the last in line. When it was my turn, the girl at the counter called me to approach the desk. She asked me who I was and what service I needed. I mentioned my name and the name of our organization. I saw that her expression changed when she heard my answer.The truth is, I was worried. I thought maybe something was wrong. Then she asked: “What is your role?” I explained that my husband and I had founded the organization and I also now serve as the general manager. She excused herself and left for a few minutes.When she came back I saw tears in her eyes. She began to tell me her story.\n\nHer story moved me deeply and brought me a deep sense of accomplishment and joy. This is exactly why Barry and I established VFI—to bring light to the lives of people who are experiencing difficulty. I did not hide my joy, and we agreed to stay in touch. It struck me that in the past, she needed my help while now it was my turn to ask for her help with the day-to-day tasks of the organization. VFI is a wheel that never stops turning, and only God can bring us into situations where we meet special people at unexpected times. I knew that this was one of those special people.When I came out of this unexpected encounter, I realized one thing: there is no limit to the happy surprises God puts in our lives. I entered the office worried and left with a sense of satisfaction and joy. The situation with the paperwork happened because I was supposed to go to this government office at this time and place to meet Orly.Stories like these are why we do what we do. Our purpose is to help people when they are in dark times and walk with them into God’s light. Our volunteers and partners make this possible. Without your love and support, who knows where Orly would be today? You have a direct impact on families going through tough times, and that is important work.We are so grateful for all you have done, and all you continue to do. May the Lord bless and keep you.Your friends, Batya and Barry Segal\n\nStay UPDATED on key events from around the world.LEARN how they relate to Biblical prophecies.PRAY for grace and provision where needed most.",
